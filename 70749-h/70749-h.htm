  <h2 id='intro' class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>“There is no end to the writing of books,” we
are told. Certainly it seems to be the fact that
one book leads to another, and the many demands
made upon me for explanations of points, problems
and paradoxes, contained in some of my recent
works, have induced me to a comprehensive effort
in the present volume. Whether I shall have
succeeded in throwing more light upon the dark
problems of Occultism, or only in making confusion
worse confounded, it is for the reader to judge.
“All truth is paradoxical,” says Laotze, the great
philosopher of Quietism. In such case it were hard
indeed to offer any argument which may be regarded
as final and conclusive, and especially is this the
case in reference to the debatable ground of
Occultism.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet a very wise writer has said that nothing can
be accepted as true which does not submit to a
mathematical statement. This is a tacit confession
of faith in the law of numerical ratios, the geometry
of the universe which underlies all revelation. We
cannot truly be said to know a thing until we have
reduced it to a mathematical concept.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may conveniently regard life as manifesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>in three stages or degrees, namely, Principles,
Causes and Effects. Our conscious relation to these
three stages of life gives rise to Ethic, Philosophy
and Science.</p>

<p class='c006'>Science is what we know of the universe; philosophy
what we think of it; ethic, how that thought
affects our conduct. Thus the final appeal is to
utility. The virtue of everything is in its use.
Science, philosophy and ethic must eventually
submit to the test of utility.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not for the sake of the mathematical statement,
nor yet for the pleasure of abstract argument,
but chiefly for the sake of utility that I have
attempted this popular exposition of Occultism, for
I think it deserves more attention than has hitherto
been given to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The idea that Occultism serves any useful end in
life may not at once appeal to the casual reader.
The deeper thinker will, however, discern in any
coherent system of thought, in any orderly statement
of fact, a possible means of self-adjustment
to the problems of life, howsoever dimly apprehended.
To the categorical imperative of Kant—I
must because I ought, but why ought I?—Occultism
offers a very definite answer. It gives
a cogent reason for all action, and may indeed be
finally judged on its ethical value. It will not be
found inadequate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Purposive action has no value without free will in
man. That “free will in man is necessity in play”
is true only of those who are not divine conspirators.
We are fated to the extent that we are ignorant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the cosmical and spiritual laws—the one order is a
reflex of the other—by which the universe is upheld.
We are culpable to the extent that we neglect those
laws we know. Science has succeeded in harnessing
many of the forces of Nature to the service of mankind.
Philosophy will bring man into conscious
relations with the laws governing his existence, and
ethic will instruct him concerning their employment
for the good of the race.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the extent that we understand the laws of our
being and use them for our personal benefit, and
through ourselves for the good of all mankind, we
become conspirators with the Divine Will, conscious
co-operators towards “that one divine far-off
event to which the whole creation moves,” an
apotheosis warranted by the trend of the physical
and spiritual evolution of humanity, and prophetically
indicated by the words: “Thou hast made him
a little lower than the angels, to crown him with
glory and worship.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As fragments in the fabric of a spiritual upbuilding,
as detached observations of the law of
universal harmony, as things of isolated interest, all
conspiring to the founding of a single idea, these
curiosities of Occultism are offered to those who are
able to appreciate them.</p>

  <h2 id='chap01' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF OCCULTISM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Before one can enter intelligently into an understanding
of Cosmic Symbolism, which underlies
all occult science, it is necessary that he should
have some well-defined conception of the meaning
and purpose of Occultism. Otherwise he will
occupy the position of one who moves in the dark,
a slave to formularies and dogmas, following blindly
where others lead and without any definite idea
as to his destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>Misconceptions regarding Occultism are very
prevalent and are found to affect the thought of
many who in their own walks are exceedingly
learned. Occultism is a broad and comprehensive
system of thought; a synthetic philosophy aiming
at self-realization, and as much concerned in the
practical development of the psychical and spiritual
powers latent in man as in the study of those
wider cosmical laws which hitherto have escaped
scientific observation, but which are found to afford
a ready explanation of man’s embodied existence,
and the wide and varied range of his faculties,
aptitudes and individual characteristics.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Occultism were merely a speculative system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of thought regarding the hidden things of Nature,
it could never find practical demonstration. If
the occult were merely the “hidden,” then Röntgen
rays, wireless telegraphy and metabolism would
have been facts of Occultism at quite a recent date.
In the first case it is confidently affirmed that
Occultism, so far from being speculative, is capable
of instant demonstration; and in the second case
it anticipated the discoveries of Science by analogous
psychical processes involved in the exercise of
clairvoyance, psychometry, telepathy and hypnotism.
Occultism is not indeed mainly concerned
in the domain of physics, but rather in those immaterial
forces which are at the back of all material
forms, of those universal laws which find their
reflection in the constitution and development of man
and the cosmos to which he is immediately related.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus while it seeks to demonstrate some unexplored
facts in Nature, it also offers a coherent system
of thought in which those facts find appropriate
places, and so in effect it affords an ethical basis for
all action which is more comprehensive than any
system which is the outcome of an insular sociology
or a national religion. Its peculiar value as a body
of teaching lies in its inclusiveness and catholicity,
its freedom from dogma, and its wide suggestiveness.
While offering a definite system of cosmogenesis
and anthropogenesis, it seeks only to throw new
light on old truths, being entirely constructive and
in no sense controversial. Unlike orthodox Science
and Religion, however, Occultism does not ignore
the facts of man’s psychic and spiritual experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Rather it makes use of these as links which bring
us into relations with that greater world and that
higher life which for Science has no interest and for
Religion no certain meaning. Thus when Science
repudiated the Chaldean account of the Genesis,
Religion was left with no ground upon which it
could convict Science of error! The Occultist
remains wholly unaffected by the incident, not
because he is either unscientific or irreligious, but
because the Book of Genesis is for him as true to-day
as when it was written. It is the work of Occultists,
and only Occultists can rightly apprehend it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the biblical cosmogenesis we are not concerned
with ordinary divisions of time called “day” and
“night,” periods of twelve hours each, more or less,
but with vast periods known as <i>pralayas</i> and <i>manvantaras</i>,
or periods of manifestation and obscuration,
taking place alternately. These great periods
answer to the systole and diastole motion of the
Great Breath, the out-breathing and in-breathing
of the Cosmic Life-force. In each of these great
out-breathings the seven stages of evolution are
realized: the Igneous, Gaseous, Fluidic, Mineral,
Vegetable, Animal and Human. But those monads
that have reached any one of these stages do not
become involved in the scheme until that stage is
reached to which they attained in the last period
of cosmic activity; but from that stage they
resume their evolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now as we have every reason to presume that
our present period of activity is not the first of our
solar system, we have reason to place a special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>meaning on the words <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>Berâsit brâ Elohim âth
hashemâyim veâth heâretz</i></span>: In the beginning the
Elohim compounded the original matter of the
heavens and of the earth. Long periods of cosmic
evolution elapsed, and at the point where the Great
Breath again reached our planet we take up the
thread of the Chaldean account <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>veheâretz tohu
vebohu</i></span>: “and the earth was chaotic and barren.”
The use of the prefix <i>vau</i> as a copulative conjunction
at the beginning of each separate statement, links
up the various stages of the evolutional scheme
without defining the vast ages, the “days” and
“nights” of the cosmos, which intervene. From
the great aqueous development we pass to the
amphibians, the “creeping things,” the avians or
“flying things and fowls of the air,” until by a
process of natural evolution and natural selection,
determined entirely by the individual power of
adaptation to environment, we at length arrive
at the evolution of the human-animal. The brief
but perfectly scientific statement, “And God (the
Elohim) made men out of the dust of the earth,”
is a process which involves an indefinitely long
period of evolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>But so far we have only the ascending arc of
physical evolution, which in effect found its apotheosis
in the production of giant human forms,
fitted to the great struggle for existence with the
saurians and pachyderms and all that mammoth
life, both vegetable and animal, by which it was
environed. “There were giants in the earth in
those days.” Nature had done her utmost in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the production of colossal forms of animal life, she
had expended all her strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was at this point, where Nature unaided would
have failed, and in process of time died down to her
root, as a tree that has put forth leaf and flower and
fruit, that the upward arc of <i>physical evolution</i> was
met by a downward arc of <i>spiritual involution</i>. The
two processes are well defined: 1. God made man
out of the dust of the earth. 2. And breathed into
his nostrils the breath of lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>In effect, from this union of spirit and matter we
get the genesis of the psyche or soul: “and man
<i>became</i> a living soul.” The process of becoming is
one that was neither immediate nor complete.
Most of us are still in the process of becoming.
But a certain number of advanced monads became
living souls, realizing their spiritual consciousness
while in the flesh. These were the “sons of the
gods” referred to in the text. All else were the
sons of men. “And the sons of God looked upon
the daughters of men and saw that they were fair.”
The self-conscious souls took to wife the daughters
of a less-evolved race, a process that would seem to
be necessary to the further uplifting and spiritual
vitalizing of the inferior grades of human life.
During the present manvantara or period of cosmic
activity we have traditional occult knowledge of
four great races of humanity before our own, each
of which attained to a successively higher state
of civilization, the Atlantean transcending the
Lemurian, as in process of time the Aryan will
transcend the Atlantean. And as each period of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>cosmic activity has afforded means of successively
higher human development, it is a question as to
what has become of those very high forms of
spiritualized humanity who were the final product
of the material and spiritual evolution of past
manvantaras. Earth-born in their origin, and linked
to this Earth’s humanity by a thousand compatriot
ties, by bonds of blood and heritage, by lives of
tireless service, they wait the time when humanity
shall have evolved to that stage when personal
intercourse is compatible with their own spiritual
status and the needs of our further evolution. To
them, as pioneers, guardians or masters of the race,
we are indebted for the universal tradition which here
and there is gathered up by Occultists the world
over, and which is realized in its integrity only by
those who have fought their way to that place in
the scale of spiritual evolution where detachment is
possible. To them is attributable the founding of
the great world religions, and at the outset these
“Sons of God” were the spiritual instructors of the
world. Each race produces its own crop of masters,
evolved initiates sworn to the service of man for
ever. As there is a natural selection, so there is a
spiritual selection, and from the moment a human
form is invested with a soul (psyche) that soul
continues to progress. There is an evolution that
has come along the natural line to the production
of human lives of great faculty and attainment;
and there is an evolution that has followed the
spiritual line. Not all evolved humans are invested
with the breath of <i>lives</i>. Thus a man may be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>intellectual giant and yet not be ensouled, for the
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>psyche</i></span> is one thing and the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>pneuma</i></span> is another.
The <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>psyche</i></span>, or <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>nephesh</i></span> is common to man and the
lower animals and is capable of immense development
when investing the human form, but unless
this <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>nephesh</i></span> is illuminated by the <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>ruach</i></span> or <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>pneuma</i></span>
it cannot advance beyond a certain stage in the
present cycle of evolution. Hence the saying,
“Work while the day is yet with you, for the night
cometh when no man shall work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Specialized humanity is a composite of spirit,
mind, soul and body. The element or principle
in man which distinguishes him from the animal
(whether human in form or otherwise), is the Mind.
Only in this possession is he truly man. The word
man comes, indeed, from the root <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>man</i></span> (<abbr title='Sanskrit'>Sansk.</abbr>), to
think. The limitations set up by embodiment of
this thinking self is the primary cause of self-realization.
All forms of life are conscious, but
only spiritualized humanity is self-conscious, or
individualized.</p>

<p class='c006'>The criterion of consciousness is response to
stimulus. It is to be seen in chemic action, in
vegetation and in animal life. If the Day’s-eye
(daisy) were not conscious of the sunrise it would
not open its petals. You may call it automatism,
a reflex of the chemic action of light. You will be
wiser if you call it consciousness of light, and so
spare yourself the trouble of pushing the question
back indefinitely, for somewhere or other you must
admit response to stimulus and there you must
posit consciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Thus while the animal soul in man responds to
stimulus of every kind coming to it through the
sense-channels, the mind responds also to a higher
and immaterial gamut of vibrations, that is to say,
to spiritual stimulus. As man he continues to evolve
while all other forms of life remain in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>statu quo</i></span>.
The monads investing them have not been caught
up by the Over-soul; they have not reached the
stage where their mass-vibration is capable of
responding to the spiritual impact; they are not
attracted.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the outcome of human evolution through
successive ages, cycles and manvantaras there is
evolved the Christ, or perfect man. The mystical
interpretation does not suffice. We require a living
individual who shall stand to us for the “man made
perfect” through that same process of spiritual
evolution which is to be our own means of final
liberation from <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>samsāra</i></span>, or cyclic rebirth. The
Christ is truly a generic title. The sons of God
are legion, and all of them are invested with the
Spirit of Truth or Christ principle. They are the
Children of Light, the Great White Brotherhood,
and at their head is the Lord, the gravitating Centre
of this world’s humanity. He is the manifestation
in time and space of the inscrutable Deity, the
revelation of God to man. The mythological interpretation
of the Christ does not suffice any more
than the mystical. The Sun and the twelve signs
of the zodiac may well stand as symbols of the
Master and his twelve disciples, but they will not
suffice for the historical fact, for the fact is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>limited to a drama in which thirteen characters
were at one time employed. It is a drama that is
playing through all time, in all places and among
all peoples. It is the great work of spiritual selection
and co-ordination, and the twelve signs are the twelve
gates through which the elect of all humanity will
enter into the New Jerusalem or Spiritual Kingdom
of a perfected humanity. Neither is the kingdom
one that is afar off. Its denizens are to be found
among embodied humanity at this day. The
Fathers and many of the early rulers of the great
countries were special representatives of the Spiritual
Hierarchy which at later stages in the history of
the world sent forth its emissaries to become world-teachers,
empire-makers, legislators, warriors and
inventors, each speaking the Word that the world
then had need of. Beside them are to be found the
Occultists of the East and West, followers of their
respective Gurus, Sadhus, Yogis and Teachers,
aspirants to the heirloom of the ages, the Gupta-Vidya
or Hidden Knowledge; with here and there a
messenger under sealed orders, passing from one
country to another; a host of psychic-researchers
and higher-thought lecturers, the aide-de-camps,
sappers and enlisting officers of the vast army of
recruits, regulars and veterans who are enrolled
under this standard.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the Occultist the universe is a symbol and every
part of it is symbolical. Although essentially an
Idealist he does not attempt the rôle of those
visionaries who would argue the universe out of
existence. He may call it elusive but not an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>illusion, for his own existence depends on his consciousness
of the world about him and his well-being
upon the degree to which he understands and
observes the laws of that universe of which he is
an integral part. For if it be said that the world
has no existence apart from our consciousness, it
may with equal truth be said that our consciousness
has no existence apart from the world to which it
is related. What we understand as the laws of the
universe are formulated in terms of our thought, but
inasmuch as the laws of thought are imposed on us
by existence, it is clear that we do not ourselves
impose cosmic laws, but we merely apprehend
them. It is not in the Idealistic sense that the
universe is a symbol, but in the real sense of it
being the embodiment or out-realizing of the
Supreme Life and Mind. As symbol the universe
is the revelation of all time, of the past and the
future; the repository of all history, the source of
all prophecy, the synthesis of actuality. That
Consciousness which is simultaneously immanent
in all the universe is called the Universal Mind.
The Platonic definition of God as “That whose
centre is everywhere and whose circumference is
illimitable” comes as nearly to this conception of
the Divine Mind as it is possible for words to compass.
Man is a centre of consciousness in the Divine
Mind from the time that he realizes his spiritual
existence, a soul investing a cell in the Brain of the
Grand Man. As such he becomes subject to the
higher spiritual laws of Being and enters into the
Divine Conspiracy. The evolving monads circulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and finally become impounded in one or another of
the various organs of the Grand Man, in agreement
with their several states of evolution, passing from
one to another of them during the successive incarnations
of the Deity. In his effort to reach a
higher sphere of consciousness and activity, a wider
sphere of influence and a greater measure of free will,
man comes to realize that obedience to the law of
his being is the means of attainment. Thus every
man is a law unto himself, and the truly wise
are they who are able to say in all consciousness:
“Thy will be done.” For human safety and
happiness are only assured by devotion to the
highest good, and this is the occult view of the
dependence of mankind on an all-seeing and beneficent
Spirit “in whose service is perfect freedom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Occultism, therefore, whether consisting in the
development and exercise of one’s individual psychic
powers, in systematic and impartial inquiry as
to evidence of these powers in others, or in the
pursuit of such studies as astrology, kabalism, yoga,
hypnotism, etc., reaches out from such vague beginnings
into regions of thought and aspiration that
transcend the average mind and are seen to culminate,
in specialized cases, in the attainment of powers
which may be called miraculous and of attributes
that are truly godlike.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 id='chap02' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> THE PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>It is quite a popular misconception that credits
Science with exact methods and certain knowledge
on all matters concerning which it has given an
opinion. There is, in fact, a slavish reverence for
the dicta of Science which is as inconsistent as
formerly was the submission of the public mind
to religious dogmatic teaching. And if, as some
writers assert, there still exists a conflict between
Religion and Science it is at least satisfactory to see
that to-day Science appears to be getting its own
back to a creditable extent. If Science makes
appeal to the popular imagination or proves its
claim to public recognition and support on the
grounds of utility, Religion has only itself to blame
if it fails to come into line with the established facts
of scientific discovery and lacks the enterprise which
is necessary to give it a modern representation.
Instead of mumbling orthodoxies about the saving
of souls, Religion could very profitably concern
itself with the task of proving that man has a soul
to save. It could use the argument afforded by
modern experimental psychology. It could observe
the scientific method, and could without loss of
dignity employ the facts of Science in the upbuilding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of a scheme of thought which has man’s spiritual
welfare as the end in view. When we recognize
the fact that it is our conception of God and of our
relations with Him that is alone effective in the
work of regeneration and reform, and that this
altered view-point is largely due to the widening
of the mental horizon by scientific discovery and
a philosophy adapted thereto, then religiously-disposed
people do wrongly to ignore the facts of
Science, however much they may appear to conflict
with orthodox notions of the relations of God to
man. It is little more than three centuries ago that
the custodians of religious belief burned Giordano
Bruno at the stake for daring to declare that there
were more worlds than one. In his <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Della Causa
Principio ed Uno</i></span> (Of the First and Only Cause)
Bruno says: “The divine Omnipotence is more aptly
expressed in an infinity of worlds of various dimensions
than in the production of a single world of
infinite dimensions.... Infinite variability is the
eternal juvenescence of God.” That which happened
to Bruno in the name of Holy Religion was barely
escaped by Copernicus because of his heresy in
declaring the Sun to be the centre of the system
and the Earth one of its satellites moving about it.
It was a pagan doctrine and belonged properly to
Pythagoras. The history of Science reveals many
such persecutions of its devotees, and yet in modern
times it cannot be said that Science is without its
prejudices. It nearly killed religious belief in the
nineteenth century owing to its recognition of the
Materialistic hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Yet when we come to examine the claims of
modern Science, or what popularly goes by that
name, we find that it is largely hypothetical and
that sciences which are usually known as “exact”
are by no means so.</p>

<p class='c006'>Science has no certain knowledge of the origin
of life and consciousness. Many distinguished men
have sought to define life. Dr. Alfred <abbr class='spell'>R.</abbr> Wallace
in his <i>World of Life</i> points out how inadequate are
all these definitions, and wisely refrains from adding
to them. Consciousness as a by-product of organic
matter was quite correct science fifty years ago.
To-day, in the presence of many well-attested
facts which go to prove the possibility of consciousness
apart from organism as we know it, the man of
science is not at all sure that consciousness is anything
of the sort. Modern psychology is a new leaf
in the book of Nature which until quite recently
had not been deciphered. We are getting our facts
sporadically, a few at a time, and each new discovery
changes our ideas concerning things which
had passed for correct theory. The facts remain;
our views of them are changed. We really have no
certain scientific knowledge about the wonderful
conversion of inorganic to organic matter. The
alchemy of Nature baffles us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even the cosmic theory is incomplete and full of
anomalies. In the vortex theory there is nothing to
show why some swirls of cosmic matter became suns
and others planets. There are two theories regarding
the solar system diametrically opposed to one
another. There are similarly two theories regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the Moon. The most recent theory is that the
Moon acts as a brake upon the Earth by causing
the tides, which run contrary to the axial rotation
of the earth, thereby slowing down its rotation and
causing a longer day than formerly. But the same
theory requires that the Moon is gradually enlarging
its own orbit and getting farther away from the
Earth, which is inconsistent with our records of
ancient observations of eclipses, etc., for in order
to agree our calculations with the observed positions
of the Moon at these ancient epochs, we have to
augment the <i>present</i> mean motion of the Moon in
its orbit by a quantity equal to about 10´´t₂, which
means ten seconds for the first century and the
same quantity multiplied by the square of the
centuries for times anterior. In other words, the
Moon was moving quicker in a smaller orbit in
former days. But this supplemental theory is
wholly destructive of the first regarding the Moon’s
tidal action. For if the Moon is getting farther
away from us, its tidal influence is also decreasing,
and the “brake” power being lessened, the Earth’s
axial rotation must be increasing in velocity and
the day must be getting shorter than formerly,
which is the exact converse of what was argued in
the first place. Hence we see how, in their efforts
to explain observed facts, scientific men can put
up two mutually destructive theories. Only recently,
in the Solar eclipse of <abbr title='seventeenth'>17th</abbr> April, 1912, we had an
illustration of an exact science blundering in practice.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Connaissance des Temps</i></span>, the official organ
of the French astronomers, gave this eclipse as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>total, while the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> gave it correctly
as partial, the apparent diameter of the Moon,
depending on its anomaly, being some 20´´ less than
that of the Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>The theory of what is called the attraction of
gravitation is one of the scientific facts which have
recently been abandoned as unsatisfactory. It is
found that the theory of “attraction” does not
answer to the facts as experimentally determined.
Theories that are inelastic are apt to be negatived
by the discovery of new facts or modified beyond
recognition by extended observations. The Earth
itself is a huge magnet whose radial influence
extends some fourteen feet beyond its surface, and
this fact has to be taken into account in all local
magnetic observations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The permeability of matter was a fact that had
been under scrutiny for a long time before the
discovery of the Röntgen rays. Sir David Brewster
notes the passage of carbon through solid wood by
means of electric fluid, and by an electric current
an acid may be separated from its sodium base
and passed through dilute syrup of violets without
changing the colour of the vegetable solution. The
question then arises, in what form was the carbon
in the one case and the acid in the other when they
passed through the respective media? Obviously
their atomic vibrations were temporarily raised in
such degree by electrical action as to change them
from their normal characters. I suggest to psychologists
that something of the same or a similar nature
may occur in the case of individuals when acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>under the influence of hypnotism or spiritual
afflatus, ecstasy, etc. The question is whether
they can be rendered permanent effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>But these are not by any means the whole of the
problems confronting modern Science, which nevertheless
has a tendency to become dogmatic in other
matters with which it is not officially concerned,
as one may learn from a reading of Häckel’s <i>Riddle
of the Universe</i>. In Ernst Häckel we see probably
the last of the old school of materialistic philosophers.
Another problem is that of atomic arrangement.
It has been observed that two chemical
bodies composed of exactly the same number of
atoms of the same elements assume entirely different
characteristics by reason of their respective atomic
arrangement. This fact, while wholly unexplained,
opens up many interesting psychological issues and
serves by analogy to explain why two human beings
compounded of exactly similar cosmic elements,
manifest different characters and faculties. Science
has too long neglected the free use of its own
hypothesis of the solidarity of the system, and while
astronomy employs interplanetary action in all its
calculations, it scouts the idea of astro-meteorology
and relegates astrology to the limbo of antiquated
superstitions. Yet both these concepts are necessary
and logical dependents of the cosmical hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to the present day Science has ignored psychology
and opposed the claims of psycho-therapeutics.
Medical science other than that depending
on surgery will soon find that the process of readjustment
in the human organism rendered necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>by the rapidly changing conditions of modern
civilization and the opening-up of new centres of
activity in the mind-sphere of the world, will present
a new series of pathological conditions to which the
prescriptions of the Pharmacopoeia are altogether
inadequate. The psychic origin of disease will have
to be admitted and provided against. The x-factor
in human pathology which defies the action
of drugs and evades the scalpel, call it by what
name we may, will increasingly assert itself, and
medical men will have perforce to take it into their
counsels, make friends with it and get to understand
its vagaries. The plurality of worlds and the
habitability of the other planets in the solar system,
taught by Pythagoras in the sixth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>,
has received a certain speculative recognition by
astronomers, notably Camille Flammarion, Richard
Proctor, Schiaparelli and Sir Robert Ball, in recent
years. It was affirmed as fact by that remarkable
man of science and inspiration, Baron Swedenborg.
But in a contemporary issue of the journal of
the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Prof.
Aitken, of the Lick Observatory, states, as the
result of his researches, that the Moon is a dead
world, with the exception perhaps of low forms of
vegetable life sustained by water vapour exuding
from the Moon’s interior; Mercury gets seven times
as much heat as the Earth and keeps the same face
towards the Sun, offering the alternative of an
eternal night or an equally unending tropical heat
and daylight, from which it is not protected by any
atmosphere. Venus, having many characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>similar to the Earth, is admitted to be problematical,
since it is not yet decided whether its day and year
are equal or not. If they are, then it is uninhabitable.
Mars has a rare atmosphere, and there is not enough
water on the planet to fill an American lake. It has
a low temperature, and there may be vegetable and
animal life there, but no beings of intelligence. The
“canals” may be natural or artificial canals or
merely earthquake markings. Jupiter is a semi-sun,
its development is in a state of chaos, and it is
probably gaseous throughout with matter distributed
as on the Sun, there being no defined surface or
crust. Saturn resembles Jupiter, but probably is
not so far advanced, and it is even less fitted for
human habitation than Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c006'>We see therefore that as between the teaching of
Pythagoras and that of <abbr title='Professor'>Prof.</abbr> Aitken there is a great
gulf fixed. It will probably be bridged by a little
freer use of the scientific imagination that Prof.
Huxley extolled. The great American astronomer
has argued humanity out of existence in a manner
so complete as to warrant the instant dismantling
of the statue of Bruno by the Vatican. But alas
for the shortcomings of dogmatic science, we have
not yet been told how or why the Earth alone is
favoured by the presence of humanity. We are
left to speculate upon the question as to what has
become of the Moon’s humanity, supposing this dead
orb was once alive and afforded habitable conditions.
We are left wondering why conservative Nature
evolved the planets Neptune and Uranus—which
“are so far away from the Sun that its light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>heat can hardly be effective in protecting life upon
them, even should life in any way originate there”—if
they are never to come within the life-belt limit
of the solar rays! These vapourings are altogether
unworthy of the name of Science, and are, in their
way, as fanciful and speculative as any of the
superstitions of a primitive religion. Who gave
the astronomer to know that man as we see him
is the only sort of humanity or intelligent being
that can exist? It is open to him to remark that
even should there be forms of intelligent life on
other planets we should not recognize them as
human. That is beside the mark; we do not
recognize the human by its form, we do not confound
the man with the animal part of him; and we may
even speak of discarnate humanity. In every
possible way we protest that articulate language,
which infers articulate thought and intelligence, is
the criterion of the human, and in this category we
include for sociological reasons all that are of human
generation, whether intelligent and articulate or not.
Of the “infinite variability” of God as expressed
in Nature, the astronomer takes no count. Here
on this globe of ours we find the human persisting
in temperatures varying from over + 150° to - 30°,
and we have no reason for suggesting that the power
of adaptation to environment is at the maximum
in this world. Violent ophthalmia and even madness
would result in us if “the earth’s green livery” were
suddenly and permanently changed to red. But
a very little alteration in the chemical constitution
of the vitreous fluid in the eye would render us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>immune from these evils, and we have every reason
for thinking that were such a colour-change to take
place, Nature would not be long in adapting herself
to the new conditions. But she would first be sure
that they were likely to be permanent, for although
very amicable, the old lady is extremely cautious
and prudent! What we know as solar light and
heat have no existence outside the earth’s atmosphere,
and even within it they only have the values
that our sensation-consciousness gives to them; so
that all we can scientifically assume in regard to
those planets that have no atmosphere is that their
humanities, if they have any, must be physiologically
different from man as we know him. We cannot
argue that he does not exist or that he cannot exist
on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sum of the matter is this, we have need of a
Religion that is scientific, and equally of a Science
that is religious. What we do not positively know
we may logically infer, but we have to guard ourselves
against the tendency to take the inference for
fact and to dogmatize about things which are wholly
unrelated to our personal experience. The many
curious observations I shall have occasion to make
in the course of these pages are so remote from general
experience and so far removed from scientific
scrutiny as to belong to the category of things
called “occult,” and it was therefore expedient that
the reader should have a fairly clear idea that all
the statements of orthodox science do not rest upon
the immovable rock of observed fact, and for this
reason are not so well founded as many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>conclusions of occult science. It is advisable also
that the reader should discern between the theoretical
value of a statement and its experimental value.
Many things which appear reasonable will not
respond to test, and others that seem unreasonable
are found nevertheless to be true.</p>

  <h3 id='chap03' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> THE MODERN MIRACLE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>It has been said that the medical practice of the
future will have to provide for the interference
in ordinary therapeutic methods of an <abbr class='spell'><i>x</i></abbr>-factor,
which is amenable to hypnotic suggestion and to
auto-suggestion, but which on rare occasions
assumes a more positive and extraordinary form, and
acts spontaneously. Indeed, we may have to admit
the possibility of an extraneous healing power acting
independently of medical skill and contrary to all
recognized therapeutic agents, medicinal or clinical.</p>

<p class='c006'>An instance of this is to be seen in what is called
the Modern Miracle. A miracle, it should be understood,
is not supernatural. We have no reason for
prescribing limits to Nature’s powers. A miracle
is simply an abnormal manifestation of those powers,
and hence something to be wondered at. The case
in point is that of Miss Dorothy Kerin, who on the
night of Sunday, the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> February, 1912, being
bedridden with advanced tuberculosis, concomitant
disease of the kidneys, and finally suffering from loss
of sight and speech, together with some signs of
aphasia, was suddenly and miraculously cured
entirely of all ailments, and when medically examined
was pronounced to be absolutely free from tubercle
bacillus, or any other form of morbid disease, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to be in complete possession of all her faculties
and normal bodily functions. The evidence is
unassailable and the facts beyond dispute. We
have to arrange our thought and modify our therapy
to accommodate these facts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dorothy Kerin was born on the <abbr title='twenty-eighth'>28th</abbr> November,
1890, in London, her father being Irish. She received
an ordinary middle-class education in a
private school, and would have gone on the stage,
where her sister, Norah Kerin, has achieved considerable
success, but for the break in her health.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of her wonderful recovery she had
not stood up for five years, and latterly had suffered
from partial loss of memory, sight, hearing and
speech. Yet she was always bright and cheerful,
and her invariable sweetness of disposition, her
patience and gentleness, endeared her to all her
friends and relatives, and made her greatly beloved
by those who came in contact with her. She was
one of those who “suffered all things gladly,” and
was by nature of a religious disposition. The
following account of her recovery is extracted from
the <i>Daily Mirror</i> report of the <abbr title='nineteenth'>19th</abbr> February—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dorothy Kerin is convinced that her remarkable
recovery of apparent health is literally ‘a miracle.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her account of the angelic vision, which on
Sunday night restored her sight, hearing and
strength and left her painless, happy and ‘feeling
better than I ever felt in my life before,’ may be
ascribed to hysteria by sceptics, but, whatever the
cause, the facts of her recovery are beyond dispute.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Frederick Norman, of Brixton, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>physician, is, of course, deterred by professional
etiquette from public discussion of her case.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘But it is no secret that my husband was incredulous,’
said Mrs. Norman to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>
yesterday, ‘when he was informed that Dorothy
was “quite well.”’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘He did not consider on Saturday that she could
possibly remain alive more than a day or two. The
girl had been in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, St.
Peter’s Home for Incurables at Kilburn, and other
institutions, but was sent home finally as a hopeless
case two years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘She has not stood up for five years, and latterly
was blind and deaf and utterly weak, taking only
occasional doses of brandy and other stimulants.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Norman has been compelled to safeguard
his patient. No fewer than sixty people saw her
yesterday, but such a reception has now been
stopped. A perfectly healthy girl could not stand
the constant excitement of receiving visitors eager
to interrogate her. Three days ago, it must be
remembered, she was in an advanced stage of
consumption.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For breakfast yesterday Miss Kerin ate wheat-meal
porridge, bacon and tomatoes, and drank two
cups of coffee. A beefsteak was cooked for her lunch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I slept last night more soundly than I ever
remember doing,’ Miss Kerin told the <i>Daily Mirror</i>
yesterday. She read the Ten Commandments
printed on the base of a minute toy magnifying
glass with perfect ease. Another doctor who was
present said he could not read such tiny print.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“‘A fortnight ago,’ said her mother, ‘Dolly
could not call things by their proper names, and
often did not know us. Bread was “soft, white
stuff,” fish was “white stuff with needles in it,”
nut-milk chocolate she asked for as “lumpy sweet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Now she can bath herself and is not an invalid
at all. Often during her long illness her
temperature went up to 105.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Kerin shakes hands firmly, and her palm
has a touch that is quite normal. Scores of doctors
have already sought permission to see her. The
history of her case is well known to the profession.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The <abbr title='Reverend'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>A. J.</abbr> Waldron, vicar of the adjoining
parish of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew’s, Brixton, visited her yesterday
and is making arrangements to have her
moved at once to a nursing home, where she can
have privacy and quiet, with country air.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Kerin has no hectic flush, and declared
yesterday that she did not feel a bit tired. But
there is little doubt she requires careful supervision
to prevent any relapse.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I am informed by her brother, Mr. <abbr class='spell'>G.</abbr> Kerin,
that during her illness, and especially during the
later stages, when her normal faculties showed signs
of decline, that Miss Kerin developed some super-normal
powers. She was able, for instance, to
give an accurate account of incidents happening
in connection with her brother while at a distance
from home. The greatest care had to be observed
by those in the house when speaking of her, as she
could always hear what was said in another room,
although she appeared deaf to those who spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>aloud in her presence. There is, in fact, evidence
that she developed the telesthesic sense during the
later stages of her illness, but also that she lost this
faculty just before her recovery.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Forbes Winslow was of opinion that the cure
was due to auto-suggestion. It appears to me a
singular conclusion. One can understand neurasthenia,
paralysis and other nervous disorders being
amenable to auto-suggestion, and in fact these are
the cases which most readily respond to such action.
But that a young girl whose mind is perfectly
resigned to what she believes to be a mortal disease,
and even suffering gladly the inscrutable ordinances
of a beneficent Providence, should after five years
of such suffering suddenly auto-suggest that there is
no organic disease in her body and that she was never
better in her life, seems to me to invest the term
“auto-suggestion” with a meaning and significance
it has never yet held. We have to remember that
here there is the certified presence of a virulent
organic disease with concomitant functional disorders.
Can Dr. Winslow advance other instances
of voluntary auto-suggestion which have instantly
cured morbid diseases? Yet we are asked to
believe that the girl auto-suggested an angelic
presence, a voice that spoke to her, hands that
touched her, and the surpassing miracle of instant
destruction in her body of all disease germs, the
restoration of all functional powers and the entire
clearing of the system of effete tissues. Then why
did she not do so five years earlier, before her forces
had been undermined by a wasting disease, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>when the will-to-be was stronger in her than it can
possibly have been at the last hour? We shall
soon be asked to believe that Miss Kerin auto-suggested
the disease itself. Another instance of your
scientific mind, which lacks the humility necessary
to say: “I do not know,” and plunges into the
most absurd speculations to explain what it does
not understand. The mental attitude of that
atheist who bowed his head and wept in the presence
of the Unknown commands our instant respect and
approval, but this foolish theorizing by reputable
men of science is only pitiable. And theories in
regard to this particular case are not lacking, for
we have in turn hypnotic suggestion (the hypnotizer
being unnamed because non-existent), collective
mental therapeutic action, answer to prayer, and
spirit-healing.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to collective mental therapy, the same objection
is raised as in the case of auto-suggestion. If
operative at all in a case of organic disease, it would
be more readily efficacious in the early stages, when
supported by a reasonable expectancy, than at the
last, when all hope had been abandoned. It is true
that for some five years prayer had been consistently
made on behalf of the patient, and we have certainly
no means of proving that this sustained effort was
not instrumental in the recovery. But we do know
that no mention was made of it by the angelic visitor.
The Presence did not say: “We have heard the
prayers of the people,” or that it came in answer to
prayer. The theory of spirit-healing is by far the
most reasonable explanation. It accounts for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>facts without, however, explaining the means by
which the cure was effected.</p>

<p class='c006'>That it is a perfect instance of organic metabolism
everybody must admit. Exactly similar cases are
difficult to find, and in effect Dr. Ash, who undertook
the study of the case after the cure had been
performed, is thereby able to give us a most interesting
account of what he regards as a unique
medical experience. The Lourdes miracles are, as
far as I know, all of a nervous character. They
pertain to cases where functional disorders arise
from nervous corrosion without lesion. Even where
there is lesion there may come a time when nervous
contact is complete and an instantaneous cure is
possible. But in the present case we have deep-seated
organic disease of a chronic nature, the
existence of morbid tissue and whole tracts of the
lungs ruined by the action of noxious germs. So far
as our experience goes it would seem that the term
“miraculous intervention” fits this case as well as
any other that can be offered, and certainly better
than many that have been applied to it. It is an
old and well-worn term, of a sort to vex the scoffer,
but when it comes to a matter of sticking on labels to
cover our ignorance of methods, we can at least
count upon the willing aid of modern science.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a categorical statement of this case by an
independent medical observer I refer the reader to
<i>Faith and Suggestion</i>, by Dr. <abbr class='spell'>E. L.</abbr> Ash, and to the
précis of that book by the editor of the <i>Occult Review</i>,
July 1912.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h2 id='chap04' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> THERAPY—ANCIENT AND MODERN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In old times, when the teachings of Hippocrates
were more in vogue than at this date, when Aristotle
and Galen and Ibn Sina and Paracelsus made their
contributions to contemporary medical science, it
was the custom to regard man in terms of the
cosmos. They classified all disorders in a comprehensive
manner as accidental or incidental, as acute
or chronic, as functional or organic. The functional
powers were governed by the Moon, the organic
constitution by the Sun. Accidental and acute
ailments were ascribed to the action of Mars,
incidental and chronic disorders to Saturn. Mars
was responsible for all inflammatory action and
fevers, while Saturn was the cause of all morbid
diseases and loss of vitality. It was only a question
of the distribution of the vital principle in man,
and this, originating in the Sun and regulated by
the Moon, induced fevers when in excess and morbid
disease when deficient in any organ of the body.
Jupiter was the great healer and arbiter of destiny,
and it was his aid that the physician invoked when
at the head of his prescription he wrote the symbol
℞—Help, O Jupiter!</p>

<p class='c006'>This ancient custom, together with many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>terms of ancient usage, is retained by modern
physicians, many of whom see no more in it than
the letter R, the initial of the word Recipe. But
we still speak of chronic diseases, while tracing
nothing to the action of Kronos (Saturn). We own
to a <i>solar</i> plexus and a <i>semilunar</i> ganglion, and there
are many other terms which have survived the
practice of putting new names to old facts when
some new function or structural peculiarity comes
under modern observation. Had the ancients
known of the existence of Uranus they would have
had a potent cause for paralysis, nervous lesion and
similar disturbances of the organism, while in
Neptune they would have found the cause of
anæmia, consumption and wasting decline, and
possibly of neurasthenia and the various effects of
nervous depletion.</p>

<p class='c006'>But who shall say, without making trial of the
matter, that the ancients were at fault in regarding
man as embodied cosmos, a compound of the free
elements in the universe about him, or wrong in
interpreting his various disorders in terms of the
stellar ambient? It is, at all events, just worth notice
that at the birth of Miss Dorothy Kerin, on the
<abbr title='twenty-eighth'>28th</abbr> November, 1890, the Sun, Venus and Mercury
were in quadrature to Saturn and in opposition to
Neptune, while on the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> February, 1912, Jupiter
was in the <abbr title='thirteenth'>13th</abbr> degree of Sagittarius, the very
degree of the zodiac that was rising at her birth. The
odds against this coincidence are 4,319 to 1. If it
were a solitary example of what is said to be the
beneficent influence of Jupiter in the saving of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>life it would not be so significant, but from the array
of evidence accumulated by modern observations
and retrogressive calculation, it is quite clear that the
ancients were justified in their ascriptions in the
case of Jupiter. Possibly it is not to the planetary
orb itself but to the cosmic synthesis represented by
it in our physical and mental constitution that
appeal is made. Be that as it may, and while
asserting the fact of planetary influence in human
life without fear of contradiction I am not in a
position to dogmatize as to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span>, it
is yet evident that there is a concert of action
between the various cosmic centres and their corresponding
principles in ourselves, such as to uphold
the theosophic concept of man as Microcosmos.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have just been speaking of cancer as a morbid
disease. It was known to the ancients and by
them named after that sign of the zodiac which
responds to the zone most frequently affected by
the disease, namely, the breast and stomach. It
has already been shown that Saturn was accounted
the chief cause of disease. Napoleon Buonaparte
died of cancer, and at his birth we find Saturn in the
sign Cancer in opposition to the Moon. On the
principle that one swallow does not make a summer,
I leave the observation for what it may be worth,
but it is satisfactory if we can recognize a swallow
when we see it. We are on the way to distinguish
between martins and swifts, and between house
and sand martins, and thus forefended from building
our house upon the sand. For although Occultism
deals with an order of facts outside the normal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>range of orthodox science its methods are equally
scientific, both analytical and constructive. If we
take the horoscopes of a number of persons whose
fatal illness was of the same nature and compare
them, we shall find a factor that is common to them
all. The existence of this factor in the horoscope
of a living person is a presumptive argument for
“tendency” to the same disease. If in event that
person develops the particular malady indicated
by the horoscope, we have at once a scientific basis
for a system of astro-therapy and a valid means of
prognosis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Assuming that the astrologers have been as busy
in their special department of research as have the
representatives of other branches of learning in
theirs, it may reasonably be expected that with an
equal body of tradition behind them and an equal
field of experimental research before them, they
have arrived at conclusions of which they are as
sure as any scientific man can be in regard to any
matter. To ignore their statements or to disparage
them without test appears to me to be wholly
prejudicial to the interests of truth and most likely
to reflect upon the scientific integrity of those who
pursue either course, for as the old philosopher
says: “Where confidence is lacking it is not met
by trust.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the faculty of auto-suggestion in
connection with psychotherapy; it has been suggested
that this faculty depends on the activity
of the subconscious sphere of the mind. It is seen
that all action is either purposive or automatic. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>purposive action tends to become habitual, and to
the extent that it becomes so, it passes from the
region of mind-control into the subconscious region
where it is capable of itself controlling the mind.
We then recognize what is called the “force of
habit.” But it is further suggested that the activity
of the subconscious part of the mind-sphere is at its
maximum when we are asleep, whether natural or
hypnotic. Certainly it is a fact that at a particular
stage in hypnosis the subject passes out of the
power of the hypnotist to control and assumes an
activity of mental function which is remarkable
both as to range and precision. But the facts seem
to suggest something more than mere automatism,
for while the patient remains subject to suggestion
there is evidence of something more than the discharge
of accumulated impressions. The subject
is not found to be blundering about in the lumber-room
of the mind, searching for odd bits of stuff that
will answer the purpose in view, but is seen to exhibit
direct perception of things as they are, the power
to traverse space and to annihilate time, and to
come into voluntary and conscious relations with
the past and the future as if they coexisted and had
a present reality. Many cases are on record. A
single well-attested case would have sufficed.</p>

<p class='c006'>These facts have given us grounds for establishing
a theory of psychism very closely akin to the teaching
of the Occultists. It is that the mind-sphere or soul
is divided into two hemispheres, one of which is
on the level of normal consciousness and the other
below it. The <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>nous</i></span> or mind is then seen to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>energized from above by the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>pneuma</i></span> through
inspiration, and from below by the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>psyche</i></span> through
instinct. Intuition and instinct, or inspiration and
passion, are thus at opposite poles of the mind-sphere,
and appeal can be made to either by suggestion
through the sphere of the mind. We trace
these opposite aspects of the mind in the Oversoul
and the animal soul of the mystical schools, the
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>augoeides</i></span> and <span lang="el" xml:lang="el"><i>antinous</i></span> of the earlier teaching. In
the Yoga system they are the Buddhic and Kamic
principles, the centres of spiritual knowledge and
of animal desires respectively, the process of Yoga
being to bring these opposite poles of our nature into
active accord.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are on record a fairly large number of
instances in which it appears that either one’s
subliminal consciousness or an extraneous intelligence
affords prescience of things in which one
is not particularly interested and for which there
is no special call. Persons have thus been given the
winning numbers in lotteries without, at the same
time, being given the means of participating in the
benefits attaching thereto. An instance quite pertinent
to the general accusation of futility lodged
against this class of intelligence came to my notice
on the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> of April, 1912. A lady, on awaking that
morning, exclaimed, “Number twenty-nine will
win!” Asked as to whether it was a number in
a lottery she at once replied: “No, it’s a horse.”
Some cudgelling of brains failed to suggest any
means by which the information could be applied.
The problem was, however, successfully solved by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>a twelve-year-old girl who took the morning paper
in hand, counted from the first name of the opening
event in the programme for the day, exhausted the
names in that event and continued into the second
event until she arrived at number 29, against which
was the name “Primrose Morn.” Obviously it
had no connection with the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> of April, but on
reflection it was remembered that the lady was born,
on the <abbr title='twenty-ninth'>29th</abbr> of the month and was engaged to be
married on Primrose Morn. Immediately below this
name in the list of competitors was “Marie’s Choice,”
and the lady’s name is Marie. The coincidence was
completed by the winning of the Bestwood Park
Plate by “Primrose Morn.” Reference to the
morning papers of the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> of April last will enable
the reader to check this statement. The rising and
bursting of these bubbles of subconscious activity
appear to be quite automatic and in most instances
without purpose or utility. They serve, however,
to demonstrate the fact that there is such a source
of inspiration, a submerged selfhood in touch with
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>anima mundi</i></span> or world-soul, upon which we can
at all times call for information and aid. The
purpose of Occultism is to put us in the way of
doing this when and as we please. From the point
of view of the world-soul, the future and the past
are coexistent. Every race is already run, every
event is historical. This gives a new and a higher
meaning to the old saying: The future is only the
past unfolded. As the old Philosopher says: Tsae
yin jo fang—all truth is paradoxical.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another interesting feature of the psychic principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in us is that of the projection of the ethereal double
or wraith. It is recorded of Goethe that he had a
vision of himself, or rather of his double, on more
than one occasion. It is well known that he had the
faculty of exteriorization of thought, the projecting
of visible thought-forms, in a remarkable degree.
This faculty of <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>Kriyas’akti</i></span> is cultivated by the
yogis of India, and forms an important feature in
all occult training. The poet Shelley frequently
effected “exteriorization” and was seen by Byron
and Trelawney and by his wife on more than one
occasion to be visibly present when it was certain
that he was some distance away from the scene.
Many such cases are on record and will be found
included in <i>Real Ghost Stories</i>, and <i>More Ghost Stories</i>,
published by the late William <abbr class='spell'>T.</abbr> Stead. I know a
yogi in India who has been certified to be visibly
present in four places at the same time. Even
allowing for slight errors of observation in regard to
time, the fact is remarkable, especially as there had
been no suggestion of pre-arrangement. The theory
of “expectancy” would not therefore cover the
ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>A correspondent sends me the following certified
experiences of psychic self-projection—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I intended visiting a great friend (who is psychic
<i>when</i> I am with her), twenty-five miles away, from
Saturday to Monday. On the previous Tuesday
night I could not sleep at all; still wide awake at
3 <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr> I suddenly thought of Miss <abbr class='spell'>H——</abbr>, and
instantly was in her dining-room, in thought, saw
vividly furniture, etc., and felt beside me her dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>dead mother (my friend). I thought we both went
upstairs together to the ‘spare room’ I usually
occupy when visiting. We went into the room,
and I walked straight to the window, held the
curtains back with my hands and looked out, then,
turned and looked at the bed, surprised to find Miss
<abbr class='spell'>H——</abbr> in it, instead of her own room; turned to the
door and came out of my ‘brown study’ to find
myself in my own bed at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I visited her on Saturday she said: ‘About
3 <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr> last Tuesday I wished you in your own
home; I slept in the spare room that night for a
change, and could not sleep; I felt you and my
mother were downstairs, and distinctly saw you
both come into the room. You went straight to the
window, parted the curtains with your hands, and
looked out, then turned your head and looked
surprised to see me in the bed and walked out of the
room.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, I had said nothing about my “psychic
visit.” Yet in every detail it was authenticated at
the other end!</p>

<p class='c006'>One night I dreamed I felt nervous (it was a
brilliant moonlit night), and that I would go into the
next room and see if <abbr class='spell'>M——</abbr> was awake for company.
I went in my nightdress, barefooted, and distinctly
shivered with cold. I found <abbr class='spell'>M——</abbr> sound asleep, so
did not awaken her. Wondering what time it might
be, I walked to the mantelpiece, where she keeps her
little clock; <i>it was not there</i>, but on a chair near the
bed. I made out fifteen minutes past something,
but the moon was not now so brilliant I thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Then feeling very chilly, I dreamed I returned to
my bed. I awoke with a shock (the shock of returning
to my body?) feeling sure I had <i>been</i> there. My
watch pointed to 4.15. My body was perfectly
warm, so it could not have been sleep-walking;
it was very frosty. Next morning at breakfast
I said: “Where do you keep your little clock?”</p>

<p class='c006'><abbr class='spell'>M——</abbr> said: “Usually on the mantelpiece, but it
is a good way from the bed these frosty mornings,
so last night I put it on a chair near my bed-head.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She also said: “I had a curious feeling when I
awoke this morning that your presence had been
in my room during the night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These experiences undoubtedly show the power
of the human mind to take form and to effect visible
self-presentation at a distance. It is presumptive
evidence for the existence of a mind-form or <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>karana-sharira</i></span>,
which if temporarily separable from the
physical centres of consciousness, may be so separated
permanently at the moment of death, and thus
assume independent and conscious existence in a
world inhering in its consciousness. While affording
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> argument in favour of a reasonable belief
in post-mortem existence, it does not prove immortality.
The two cases stand upon entirely
different grounds and require distinctive evidence.
I know that after the butterfly has emerged from the
chrysalis it has independent existence and that it is
neither grub nor chrysalis, but a potentiality that has
become realized in a new order of being. But I also
know that the butterfly comes to an end. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>problem is concerned with the soul of the butterfly
and what becomes of it thereafter. The case is not
identical but merely analogous. The human evolution
is presumably a good many stages beyond that
of the lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet I find it quite the usual thing, especially among
Spiritualists, to regard evidence of post-mortem
existence as equivalent to evidence for immortality.
Occultism, in common with all the great Religions,
teaches that post-mortem existence is natural and
imperative, while immortality is spiritual and
conditional. If the shell of a nut be broken the
kernel will continue to exist as nut for a considerable
time. It is thus with the psychoplasm after
separation from the physical body or shell. It is
said of those who have attained: These are they
over whom the <i>second death</i> hath no power. The
tendency to regard all that is not physical as being
spiritual in its nature and constitution, is one of the
greatest fallacies to which modern interpreters of
psychic phenomena have contributed. A change
in the sphere of activity does not involve change
of character, nor does it determine the degree of
spiritual consciousness of the individual. That is
a matter of evolution, of knowledge and devotion.
The confessed ignorance of discarnate intelligences
upon matters mundane and spiritual is sufficient
evidence of this fact.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>There is one star above all others which periodically
sheds its light upon the world, but about which
very little is known, and on the occult significance
of which little or no light has been hitherto shed.
I refer to what is popularly, and as I shall show,
correctly known as the Star of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c006'>I propose to bring the facts into review with the
intention of finally establishing the place of this
star in cosmical symbology, and also of showing its
connection with the central fact of the Christian
religion—the Nativity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Star is due to make its appearance during
the present century, but at what precise date
cannot be determined, owing to lack of data. It
was seen in the year 945, again in 1264, and by
Tycho in 1572, and after becoming visible in the
daytime, so great was its lustre, it gradually faded
away and disappeared. Sir <abbr class='spell'>J.</abbr> Herschel thought
from these facts, that it would reappear in 1872,
but such was not the case. The appearance of
a large luminous star in Perseus at the beginning
of this century led to the belief that it was the long-expected
visitant. The body, which was named
Nova Persei, was eventually considered by astronomers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to be a centre of disruption, on account of
its sudden flaring up and disappearance. It may
have been this or a collision of two telescopic stars.
Tycho tells us that the Star gradually grew in
luminosity until it outshone Sirius and even Venus,
and as gradually disappeared. This seems to
suggest a star of great eccentricity and vast orbit,
whose major axis is at right angles to the sphere
of visibility, so that it appears to us “end on.”
It would thus grow and gradually disappear,
without any sensible alteration of its position
in the heavens, as here depicted—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig01.jpg' alt='Figure 1.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is of interest to note that mythology connects
the Star with Cassiopeia, Andromeda her daughter,
and Perseus the husband of Andromeda. These
three constellations are in close proximity to one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>another in the heavens; together with Cepheus, the
husband of Cassiopeia and father of Andromeda.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Star appeared above “the head of Andromeda,”
according to Tycho, which would give it
about 32° of N. declination, and thus make its
appearance vertical to the latitude of Bethlehem in
Judea. The sign of the zodiac coinciding with its
longitude would thus be Aries, which according
to Ptolemy rules over Judea. It is the Oriental
sign and stands in relation to the cardinal points
thus—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig02.jpg' alt='Figure 2.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 2.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This observation satisfies the requirements of that
passage where the Magi are reported to have said:
“We have seen his Star in <i>the East</i>, and have come
to worship Him.” Then if a geographical quarter
was referred to by “the East,” why should they
travel westward from Persia to Judea? Obviously
they referred to the quarter of the Heavens, and,
being Astrologers, would well know that Judea was
signified by Aries, in which sign the Star made its
appearance. Its “standing over the house where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the child lay,” indicates its position in the zenith of
Bethlehem at the time of its southing, the latitude
of Bethlehem being 31° 43´ N. in agreement with
the observed position of the Star in Tycho’s
day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now regarding the year of the Nativity, we know
that it was in the same year as the death of Herod.
This event can be fixed. Josephus, in his <i>Antiquities</i>,
<abbr title='liber'>lib.</abbr> <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii</abbr>, mentions an eclipse that took
place on the night preceding one of the fasts, and
which was immediately followed by the last illness
of Herod. We know from the same source that
Herod reigned thirty-four years after the death of
Antipater, and thirty-seven from the beginning of
his reign. The date is further fixed by the statement
that this latter event took place in the 184th Olympiad,
and we hence get the year of Rome 714 or
39 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and the year of the eclipse would therefore
be 3 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> The same author says that after mourning
Herod for seven days, the feast of the Passover was
approaching, and as this was always held on the
<abbr title='fourteenth'>14th</abbr> of Abib or Nisan, which is the first full Moon
after the Equinox, we are able to confirm the date
as the <abbr title='thirteenth'>13th</abbr> March. At this date it is found that
there is a considerable eclipse of the Moon as shown
by the following calculation (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>).</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun being 7° 34´ from the Node, the extent of
the eclipse would be nearly five digits, and the
Moon would be about two-thirds down the western
sky and in the south-west quarter of the heavens.
It is of interest also to note that the Moon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>eclipsed in the sign Virgo, which the ancients say
rules Jerusalem, where Herod the Tetrarch died.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the R.C. Festes we are told that the death
of Herod took place before the Passover and after
the eclipse of <abbr title='thirteenth'>13th</abbr> March, so that the date appears
to be very well established.</p>

<p class='c014'>Luke also gives confirmatory evidence, and the
account is very circumstantial. The Evangelist
mentions Tiberius Cæsar by name, and also the
Governors of the Provinces, as well as many dates.
From him we learn that the Mother had good
reason to be in or near Bethlehem at that time,
because there was a registration or census under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Augustus which was fixed for the First of Tishri,
when the Jewish civil year commenced. In the
same month was the feast of Tabernacles, an additional
reason for the journey. Bethlehem was their
objective, “because they were of the house and
lineage of David,” who was born at Bethlehem.
Now the <abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Tishri would fall in that year on
<abbr title='nineteenth'>19th</abbr> September. At this time there would be
“shepherds abiding in the fields by night,” that
being the hot season. The <abbr title='twenty-fifth'>25th</abbr> December is, of
course, an impossible date.</p>

<p class='c006'>I now take my cue from the Apocalypse: “A
woman clothed with the Sun and the Moon under
her feet. And she brought forth the Man-child who
should rule the nations with a rod of iron.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun in the middle of the sign Virgo is the
woman clothed with the Sun. To be “clothed”
with the solar rays the luminary must be in the
middle of the sign and neither just entering it nor
just leaving it. The “Moon under its feet” signifies
a full Moon, when the lunar orb was in the opposite
point of the zodiac, namely, the middle of Pisces.
“A rod of iron” indicates that the Man-child was
born under the planet Mars, <abbr class='spell'><i>i. e.</i></abbr> under the rising
of the sign ascribed to the government of that planet.
We have to construct a horoscope which, while in
actual accord with astronomical facts, exhibits
these features.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have already seen that the full Moon of
March fell on the <abbr title='thirteenth'>13th</abbr>, and if to this we add the
values for six lunations, we shall have the full Moon
of September in the year 4 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, thus—</p>

in the orient. Saturn and Jupiter were then in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>close conjunction in the beginning of the sign
Taurus, Mars just entered, into Leo, Mercury towards
the end of that sign, Venus setting as an “evening
star” in Libra 22°, and Neptune in the sign Scorpio.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we find Mars, the ruling planet in the sign
Leo, ruling Judah, hence Jesus is referred to as
the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. The prophecy of
Jacob was that Judah should be as a lion crouching
down. “A sceptre shall not depart from Judah
nor a law-giver (Cepheus) from between his feet,
until Shuleh come.” This Shuleh is the name of
the star Cor Scorpio on whose rising Leo declines
from the position of meridian power. It is in accord
with the universal symbology that here in the sign
Scorpio we find the planet Neptune in the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr>
division of the heavens, signifying “betrayal unto
death.” The Moon, ruler of the <abbr title='fourth'>4th</abbr> House, conjoined
with Uranus in the <abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> House, in opposition
to the Sun is an additional indication of an
untimely end, and that on account of secret enmity.
The sign Scorpio is associated with the principle
of evil and is called the accursed sign. The tribe
of Dan, to whose lot this division fell, substituted
the symbol of its antiscion, Aquila, the eagle, on
that account. Among the disciples it was connected
with Judas Iscariot.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Pascal full Moon of <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 33 fell on <abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr>
April at 2° 55´ <abbr class='spell'>G.M.T.</abbr>, the Sun being about 6½°
from the Node. The time at Jerusalem was 5.16
<abbr class='spell'>p.m.</abbr>—“about the sixth hour.” The Sun was
then close to the Star in Aries, known as Alnatha,
<i>i.e.</i> “the slain lamb.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The universality of this incarnation has been
frequently commented upon. The cosmical Man
has employed the symbolism of the whole of the
solar system as known to the ancients. Thus we
have him referred to as—</p>

<p class='c006'>Saturn—“A man of sorrows.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jupiter—“The Sun of Righteousness,” and a
“priest after the order of Melchizedek,” <abbr class='spell'><i>i. e.</i></abbr> the
King of Righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mars—The sword bearer, “I came not to bring
peace but a sword.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sun—“The Day-star from on high.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Venus—“The Prince of Peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mercury—“The Word,” “The Messenger.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Earth—“Son of Man,” <abbr class='spell'><i>i. e.</i></abbr> Adam—Earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jesus the Prophet and Master of Wisdom is of the
order of those “whose goings forth are from of
old.” Some have seen in Him the reincarnation
of the Buddha, whose ethical doctrine is strongly
akin to the teachings of the holy Nazarene.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are strong reasons in the astrological
scheme here presented, to warrant all Occultists in
accepting the Incarnation in a sense other than
symbolical or mythological. The prophecies and
the record agree with the astronomical facts. Jesus
is called especially “the Lamb of God,” and is
born under the rising of the sign Aries. He is called
also the “Lion of the Tribe of Judah,” and Mars,
the ruler of the horoscope, is found in Leo. He is
called “the Virgin-born,” and we find the Sun at
the Nativity in the sign of the Virgin. These positions
are not accidental, but are in agreement with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the particular state of the visible heavens at the
epoch to which we are impelled by reference to the
facts of the case in conformity with the historical
record.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have, I think, specific evidence of the Incarnation—of
what? Of the Christ, the Logos,
the Word. Jesus the man, whose horoscope we
have been tracing, is not to be confounded with the
Christ principle investing that Personality, nor yet
with the Spirit of God animating the Christ. The
relationship of these are apparently as Spirit, Soul
and Body to one another, that is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Spirit = God.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Soul = Christ.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Body = Jesus.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This order seems to be supported by the earliest
statements of the Christian faith. The Master-Soul
speaking through the person of Jesus said: “These
things I do not of myself but of the Spirit of God
which dwelleth in me,” and again, “Know ye not
that ye are the temple of God and the Spirit of God
dwelleth in <i>you</i>?” Further, the Master in bidding
farewell to His disciples said, “I go unto my Father
and your Father, unto my God and your God.”
It is clear, therefore, in what relations the incarnate
Christ stood to humanity and to God. Other
masters have appeared at various times as manifestations
of the Spirit of Truth, Bodhisattvas as they
are called in India, and are seen to be the founders
of schools of religious thought in all parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>world. They all answer to the universal paradigm,
and consequently we find the same myths and legends
centring in them. Occasionally we get specific
record of the birth of these Great Souls. Thus
we know that Confucius (Kong-fu-tze) was born
550 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> on the <abbr title='twenty-seventh'>27th</abbr> day of the <abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> month, and
died on the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> day of the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> month in the
year 477 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, at the age of seventy-three years.
The birth of Gautama Sakyamuni is vaguely indicated
as having taken place at the full Moon of
Jyestha. So far no records have been discovered
to throw light upon the year of birth, so that we
cannot determine the cosmic relations of this
great luminary. The birth of Sri S’ankarāchārya,
however, is specifically indicated in a stanza of
Yidyāranya, where it is said that the Sun, Saturn,
Jupiter and Mars were all in their exaltation
signs, that is to say, in Aries, Libra, Cancer and
Capricorn respectively; and in <i>Kendra</i>, <abbr class='spell'><i>i. e.</i></abbr> in
signs that were upon the angles of the horoscope.
This is the ideal horoscope of the successful reformer,
and this Confucius of India, who began his crusade
at twenty years of age, has left his mark for all time
upon Indian thought and literature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wherever we can obtain the time of the incarnation
of these Great Souls, it is seen that either there
are some special celestial portents attending them
or the planetary positions are such as to stamp the
horoscope at once as that of an epoch-making birth.
The portents attending the birth of Romulus, as
recited by Dionysius, are no less striking than those
which signalized his death. Something of this sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>was obviously the belief in Shakespeare’s time
concerning the death of great men—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When beggars die there are no comets seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of Princes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>From this we may conclude that the gods are not
democratic, but favour individualism of the most
pronounced type; and if, as would seem to be the
case, the whole trend of evolution is the specialization
of faculty, the elaboration of the unit from
the mass, we can readily understand why specially
selected cosmical conditions attend the incarnation
of highly-evolved souls.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>A consideration of great astronomical epochs
naturally leads to the more comprehensive subject
of Periodicity and the Law of Cycles. Some notes
in my former works have raised special points of
inquiry which may very well be dealt with in the
present chapter.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is known as the Great Year of Plato is one
of those occult statements which seem to point to
the existence among Initiates of some degree of
special knowledge in cosmical facts. The observation
of the Precession of the Equinoxes is usually
ascribed to Hipparchus, who lived in the Second
Century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> By comparison of the star positions
in his day with those of Timocharis a century earlier,
it was found that while maintaining their relative
distances from one another and from the ecliptic,
the stars had altered their positions in regard to the
equinox, and a rough calculation showed that they
were moving at the rate of about 50´´ per year.
Observations of particular stars, while confirming
the fact of their change of longitude, did not yield
uniform results, and this no doubt was due to the
imperfection of the instruments employed. Thus
in regard to the star Spica Virginis we have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>following observations of its longitude at various
dates by independent authorities—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Timocharis, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 293, Spica observed in Virgo, 22° 20´</div>

      <div class='line'>Hipparchus,  ”   145,   ”        ”        ”    24° 20´</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ptolemy,     ”   139,   ”        ”        ”    26° 30´</div>

      <div class='line'>Copernicus,  ”  1515,   ”        ”      Libra, 17° 14´</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Thus while the fact of Precession is very clearly
defined by these observations, the amount of it
is not accurately determined. Later observations
with more perfect means of measurement have
enabled the official astronomers to give a true
value to the Precession of the Equinoxes, which is
50·2453´´ plus O·0002225´´ <abbr class='spell'><i>t</i></abbr> where <abbr class='spell'><i>t</i></abbr> is the number
of years from 1850. Thus while Hipparchus and
Ptolemy found it to be 1° in 100 years, Albatani
found it to be only 1° in 66 years, and modern
observations seem to point the fact that it has been
accelerated up to our own time. By taking a mean
of all observations during the last eighteen centuries,
the amount appears to be 50·062´´ and by extending
the observations we can work it down to 50´´ nearly.
Now if we divide the circle of the zodiac, or 360°
by 50´´ we shall arrive at the figures 25,920 comprised
in the Great Year. There are two theories in existence
as to the cause of this Precession. At the
point of time when the Sun crosses the Equator and
comes to the first point of Aries, let the Sun be in
line with a star in the heavens. When the Sun
returns to the same position on the Equator it is
found not to be in line with that star but 50´´ in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>advance of it. The first theory is that this is due
to the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, or, what
is the same thing, in the inclination of the earth’s
axis to the plane of the ecliptic, a change caused by
the action of the Moon and Sun on the equatorial
bulge. The whole effect is taken to be about 50´´
as said, and of this 35´´ is due to the Moon and 15´´
to the Sun. Various observations have shown this
change of axial inclination to be about 50´´ per
century, or one one-hundredth part of the Precession
of the Equinoxes. Of this I shall have something
to say later. For the moment we may consider it
as part of the theory of Precession. The other
theory is that Precession is caused by the proper
motion of the Sun through space, whereby it completes
an arc of 50´´ of its vast orbit every year.
Then the gradual increase of the Precession already
noted would in terms of this theory be due to the
fact that the earth is getting nearer to the Sun and
consequently the angle of parallax would be greater.
Here we may leave the theorists with their own
material and turn to the significance of this Great
Year.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the whole Year consists of 25,920, during which
the Equinoxes precess an entire circle, there will be
a period of 2160 occupied in traversing one sign, that
is to say, a twelfth part of the circle. Now this
period is 72 periods of the planet Saturn, otherwise
known as Kronos, the god of Time. From this
again we derive the foundation of the great Yugas
or Ages known to the Indians and referred to in
the Vishnu Purana as the Four Ages, Satya-yuga,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Treta-yuga, Dvapara-yuga, and Kali-yuga. They
correspond with the four ages known as the Gold,
Silver, Copper and Iron ages. Thus—</p>

<p class='c014'>At present the Vernal Equinox is at the very end
of the constellation Aquarius, and there was a time
when the equinox fell in the middle of Taurus, and
the solstices in the middle of Leo and Aquarius
respectively. Thus we find Varaha Mihira, an Indian
astronomer of the fifth century, stating that in his
day the solstices fell in Katakam (Cancer), and
Makaram (Capricornus), but that according to
former shastras they were once in the middle of
Aslesha (Leo) and Kumbha (Aquarius) respectively.
This tells us that some two thousand years before
Mihira’s time there were Indian observations which
determined the positions of the solstices among the
asterisms, and it cannot have failed to strike Mihira
that there was such a fact as Precession, even supposing
that he had no knowledge of it from the Greek
and Egyptian astronomers. It was about this time,
namely 2000 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, that the Babylonian empire was
at its height, and accordingly we find the astronomical
facts written in all their records and built into
their architecture. We find it in the Assyrian Bull
and in the Egyptian Sphinx, wherein the four
constellations which then held the cardinal points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>are found to be compounded. They comprise
Taurus the Bull, Leo the Lion, Aquarius the Man,
and Scorpio (Aquila) the Eagle.</p>

<p class='c006'>In connection with the position of the Vernal
Equinox in the constellations, there are a number
of very interesting myths and symbols which
form an essential part of Occultism. We find, for
instance, that at the time when the equinox was in
the constellation Taurus the worship of the Bull as
a symbol was closely associated with the Spring
festivals. The Egyptians at this time decked a
white Bull with garlands of flowers and set a golden
discus between his horns to represent the entry of
the Sun into the constellation of the Bull. Later,
when the signs of the zodiac became confused with
the constellations by the fact of their coincidence,
the same myths and ceremonies were transferred to
the signs, and remained associated with them in the
popular use. Hence the May Day festival, which
had its origin with the Sun in the constellation
Taurus at the Vernal Equinox, came to be associated
with the entry of the Sun into the sign Taurus in the
month of May.</p>

<p class='c006'>History brings to us a curious confirmation of the
astronomical basis of the Bull ceremonials. The
Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt is stated to
have taken place in 1491 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> Now we have already
seen that Mihira, the Indian astronomer, noted the
Vernal Equinox at his time to have been coincident
with the first point of the constellation Mesham
(Aries), and, as his date is fixed by calculation to
have been <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 536, the interval would consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be 1491 plus 536, or 2027 years. And if we multiply
this by 50·1´´, the mean precession per year, we
shall have as result 28° 12´ 35´´, which, added to the
first point of Aries, takes us to the end of that constellation
on to the verge of the constellation Taurus.
Hence we conclude that about the time of the Exodus
the Equinox was passing out of Taurus into Aries,
and consequently we find the institution of the
Jewish Passover (Pasach), to have been inaugurated
by Moses who was “learned in all the lore and
language of the Egyptians” and who, as the adopted
son of the Egyptian Princess, would be initiated by
the Priests of Isis into all the mysteries of the
cosmos to which at that time they had access. When,
therefore, the Israelites were found to be perpetuating
the worship of the Golden Calf which they had
witnessed in Egypt, the great Lawgiver admonished
them, reduced their idol into an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aurum potabile</i></span> by
his alchemical skill and gave it them to drink.
Thereafter the symbol of the Ram became paramount
in Israelitish worship. The Pasach or transit was
none other than that of the Vernal Equinox from
the constellation Taurus into Aries. Occultists
have identified the sign Taurus with the age of the
Patriarchs, the age of husbandry and the ascendancy
in Egypt of the Hyksoi or Shepherd Kings. The
age of Aries marks the cycle of militarism, extending
to Assyria, Persia, Egypt and Greece, and culminating
in the Roman Empire. Pisces marks the age
of Combination, culminating in the federation of
the Anglo-Saxon peoples. The present-day transit
into the constellation Aquarius is held to inaugurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the dawn of the age of Baptism, the pouring out of
the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh, and the age will
therefore be one of spiritual regeneration.</p>

<p class='c006'>What are called the Four Fixed Signs of the zodiac,
those which enter into the composition of the Sphinx,
are found to be in the forefront of national symbolism
among the ancient Chinese. The four cardinal
constellations are associated with the four colours,
black, red, white and blue. The constellation of
the Lion was called by them “the Black Warrior,”
Taurus was called “the Azure Dragon,” Scorpio
the “White Tiger” and Aquarius “the Red Bird.”
In the time of Wan Wang there was built a palace
whose four walls were of these colours, and we find
them represented in the heraldry of the Yellow
Empire.</p>

<p class='c006'>In both Egypt and Assyria we find the Bull used
as a sacred symbol, even as it is to this day in India.
There is a connection of a subtle nature between
the Bull and the Bee—Apis. In the most ancient
Mithraic monument of Assyria there is shown in
bas-relief the figure of a lion out of whose mouth a
bee is coming forth. This at once brings to mind
the riddle of Samson, himself associated with the
Solar myth. He is made to say: “Out of the eater
came forth meat, out of the strong came forth
sweetness.” And when they gave him the answer:
“What is stronger than a lion, what is sweeter than
honey?” the key to the symbology is supplied in his
answering words: “If you had not ploughed with
my oxen (Taurus), you had not found out my riddle.”
Here there is an obvious association of the symbol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of the Bull with that of the Bee, and it is here that
we get the affiliation of the two signs Taurus and
Leo. A lion trampling on a snake and a bull in the
folds of a snake are to be found among the symbolical
monuments of the past. The lion-headed man,
Abraxas, is a symbol which links the sign Aquarius
to that of Leo, and is of great antiquity: among the
Persians we find this word Abraxas or Abracax
engraved on magical stones. It stands for the
365 days of the year and the virtues corresponding
to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this Taurean key to the riddle of Samson is
not merely a cosmical symbolism. It is also a
spiritual one. For the four Fixed Signs of the
zodiac stand for the basic elements or what are
known as the Four States, and these in their turn
have analogy with human principles. Thus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Leo       represents Fire, which stands for <span class='sc'>Spirit</span>.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In this paradigm we have Spirit above and Matter
beneath, linked together by the Human Soul or
Mind in relations with Spirit, and the Animal Soul
in relations with Matter. The riddle of Samson
therefore may be read kabalistically thus: Out of
Spirit proceeded Matter, as from Fire the element
of Earth was evolved. To which we may add the
rider in corresponding terms: Save by incarnation
you could not attain to spiritual liberation, which is
equivalent to the saying: If you had not ploughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>with my oxen, you had not found out my riddle.
Here we have the process of differentiation covertly
referred to by the propounder of the riddle, showing
that Matter is the ultimate expression of Spirit, its
negative pole. It stands for the female principle
in Nature, and hence the tradition involves the
woman who betrayed Samson’s secret. Thus in
cosmical symbology some of the great secrets of
cosmogenesis and anthropogenesis lie concealed.
The ancient wisdom conceived the two schemes as
involved in the complete arc of life, which holds
good for any planet, and for the system to which
it belongs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Four states of matter and their corresponding
evolutes may be thus figured—</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In a subsequent section we may profitably consider
the analogy existing between the cosmical
and anthropological evolutions, and the consequent
relations of the human soul with the planet to which
it is related in the scheme of things.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>The possibility of a scientific foreknowledge of
events has long engaged the minds of speculative
thinkers. In properly informed minds it has
assumed an actuality. The learned writer of <i>The
Story of the Heavens</i> has given us a most interesting
account of the manner in which the law of the Tides
gradually came to be connected with the Moon, and
how at length some astute observer formulated a
scheme based on the Moon’s age, by which the time
of high or low tide could be predicted. That was
a case of scientific foreknowledge. When to the
laws of Kepler, which gave a mathematical construction
to the whole system of astronomy, Sir
Isaac Newton contributed his great law of Gravitation,
the coherence of the whole cosmical scheme
was manifest. Kepler showed that planetary motions
answered to the functions of the ellipse.
Newton demonstrated the necessity of this cosmical
fact. Herschel discovered the proper motion of
the Sun in space and upset the whole scheme.
Although answering to the functions of an ellipse,
of which the stationary Sun occupied one of the foci,
the necessary fact immediately assumed the less
rigid form of relative fact, and the ellipse gave place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to the cycloidal curve. A cycloidal curve is that
described by any point on the tyre of a revolving
wheel whose axle is progressing at the same time in
a straight line. Let the Sun occupy the position of
the axle, and let a planet be situate at the end of one
of the spokes of the wheel upon the tyre. If the
wheel be now moved forward it will be found that
the Sun-point is moving in a straight line parallel
to the ground on which the wheel rests, while the
planet-point describes a series of arches. It never
gets farther away from the centre to which it is
united. The planet point, in fact, describes a segment
of a circle the chord of which is equal to the
circumference of the wheel. We are under no
necessity of supposing that the Sun’s path in space
is rectilinear. On the contrary, we have presumptive
evidence that it is itself answering to the
gravitational pull of some body in the remote
confines of space and pursuing an orbital path.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are here dealing with a rigid vector, which is
not the case as regards the planetary bodies. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>is a difference in nature between the spoke of a wheel
that holds the tyre to the hub and the force of
gravity that holds a planet to the Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then our cycloidal curve falls of itself into the
region of relativity. It would only be true if the
Sun’s path in space were rectilinear, not otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we have got to our point where the elements
of our system assume coherence only by their
relativity. This fact is so well established that
scientific prediction is a thing assured. Every year
there is issued a volume of astronomical facts which
antedate our calendar by some three or four years.
I refer to the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>. In this volume we
shall eventually find not only that the tides have
been correctly predicted, but that every phase of
the Moon is accurately stated, its orbit among the
stars clearly defined; the times of its occulting or
hiding the various stars that happen to lie in its
course; the time, place and magnitudes of the various
eclipses, and a host of other phenomena, are seen to
have been foretold. This knowledge could not be
otherwise derived than from an intelligent study of
an intelligible cosmos, and a clear definition of the
laws governing cosmical relations. Keep that in
mind. We live in a world of relativity. What we
call cosmic laws have only a relative value. The
Ptolemaic system of epicycles was relatively true
to the view of the universe which regarded the Earth
as the centre of the system. It answered to all the
phenomena. It had an integrity of its own. When
the view-point was shifted so that the Sun came to
be regarded as the centre of the system, then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>epicycle no longer held good. But the elliptical
theory of Kepler was only a relative truth. The
planets do not really move in elliptical orbits. They
only appear to do so from the point of view of a
<i>fixed</i> central Sun. The theory, like that of Ptolemy,
answers to the phenomena. The same can be shown
in regard to the cycloidal system. In the astronomical
text books it will be found that the Precession
of the Equinoxes is ascribed to the change in the
inclination of the earth’s axis caused by the attraction
of the Moon and Sun, but principally of the
Moon, on the equatorial bulge of the earth. The
same text books will tell you that the Precession is
found to be increasing, that the Moon is receding
from the earth, and that the attraction of gravitation
decreases as the square of the distance! All of
which is a contradiction in terms.</p>

<p class='c006'>But since we have arrived at the fact of relativity
in regard to what we are used to calling astronomical
“facts,” we may as well face the situation
and accept the universe as symbol. Then all facts
concerning it come to be regarded as merely symbolical,
and it is our business to relate this universal
symbology to the things of our consciousness and
the facts of daily life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a system was evolved ages ago by the
philosophers of the East, in China, in India and in
Chaldea. They called this system by the name of
Astrology, that is, what we reason or discourse concerning
the stars. They regarded the stars, not as
bodies having a fixed quantitative relationship to the
cosmos, but as symbols having a significance in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>consciousness and a value in terms of experience.
These values were doubtless assigned from observation.
Human nature remaining very much the
same throughout long ages, the symbolism thus
instituted would have a more or less constant value.
That is how we find it. What Saturn signified two
thousand years ago it signifies to-day. It is an open
question whether the planets have a causative
relationship in regard to the affairs of human life.
Before we can decide this point we have to prove our
theory of gravitation, making of it an absolute
instead of merely a relative fact. Then, if the
planets interact one upon another, as what is called
the “solidarity” of the system seems to require,
we cannot very well escape from the logical consequences
of our reasoning, and planetary action in
human life must be a fact beyond controversy. But
the planets may very well have a symbolical value
as being part of the universal inscription, a feature
in the great physiognomy. We may argue from
this point of view with perfect safety. It is our
business to study this physiognomy of Nature, to
read the symbolism of the heavens in the same
intelligent manner as we read the symbolism of the
Earth. It may be said that the whole art of living
consists in what the ancients called the “end-viewing
perception,” seeing the end from the beginning,
which is our modern “intelligent anticipation.”
The Genesis account gives a symbolical value to the
Sun, Moon and planets, when it says: Let them be
for signs (Othoth), and this othic value was early
discovered by the ancients and has held to this day.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>There are various means of foreknowledge, but all
cannot be called scientific, although they may be
the subject of scientific scrutiny. Inspiration or
revelation escape our apprehension. What we
know as the gift of the Spirit does not lend itself to
scientific empiricism. Direct perception, as in clairvoyance
or seership, is allied to certain temperamental
peculiarities which can be noted but barely
accounted for. Mediumism and obsession may
sometimes be the source of foreknowledge of events,
and these are the legitimate subjects of study by
psychologists. To these we may add the various
forms of Automatism when applied to divination,
and Numerology or Kabalism. The latter, while
depending on an universal symbolism and the
geometrical relations of thought, is somewhat distinct
in that it lends itself to empirical test. Indeed,
it may be said that all the foregoing methods of foreknowledge,
except direct revelation, may be rendered
scientific. That they are not yet so is due to
our defect of knowledge concerning the nature and
constitution of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>In effect we make final reference to Astrology as
the only means of scientific foreknowledge known to
man, and in this we must include the physical
phenomena which have direct relation to astronomical
facts as well as anything we may argue
concerning the action of the planets upon the minds
of men and the disposition of human affairs. Astrology
lends itself readily to experimental test. It
does not necessarily assume a causative relationship
between man and the various bodies of the solar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>system, but it is open to show that there is an actual
relationship between the state of the heavens at the
moment of a person’s birth into the world and the
character and experience of that person through
life. There is no need in this place to elaborate the
argument. The facts are sufficiently well attested
in the experience of all who have taken the trouble
to apply the ordinary tests. As to character,
Ptolemy affirms that Mercury is the indicator of
the rational powers, the Moon of the natural powers.
By the rational he means those that are peculiar to
man, by the natural, those that are common to man
and the lower animals. The distribution of the
faculties and powers are thus symbolically located—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig05.jpg' alt='Figure 5.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is an obvious consent here to the principles
of modern Phrenology as enunciated by Dr. Bernard
Hollander. It is seen that all the intellectual
faculties, the perceptives, memories, the comparative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and rational faculty, are under the sway of the planet
Mercury. Jupiter governs the sympathetic faculties,
intuitive perception, mirthfulness, wit, benevolence;
Saturn the devotional faculties, wonder, sublimity,
veneration; the Sun has rule over the governing
group of faculties—firmness, conscientiousness, love
of approbation, stability; Venus over the social
group—friendship, inhabitiveness, constancy, etc.;
the Moon over the natural faculties—vitativeness,
amativeness, love of offspring, etc.; Mars over the
faculties of defence and destruction; Uranus over
the psychic faculties, and Neptune over the spiritual.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Astrology the Sun is considered as the radiating
centre of vital energy, and has relations with the
heart and the solar plexus. The Moon is the distributor
of this energy, and represents the element of
variability, being allied to the sympathetic ganglion,
and having relations with the fluidic body; it also is
related to the spleen. The Sun and Moon acting
together, as in the production of the tides, may be
regarded as the generator and distributor of all astral
influences. According to the positions of the planets
at the moment of birth in regard to the luminaries,
astrologers draw their conclusions regarding the
constitution and functional powers of the individual.
But there is also another most important local factor
which plays a very significant part in the determination
of personal powers.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we take the vertical circle in the centre of which
a birth takes place, we shall find that this prime
vertical is divided into two parts by the meridian
which cuts it at right angles, and again by the horizon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>at right angles to the meridian circle. These
two great circles represent sensitive planes which
are capable of responding to the astral vibrations in
force at any time, the intensity of such vibrations
being in direct proportion to the nearness of the
planets to such planes. Hence it is found that
planets which are exactly rising or setting, culminating
or passing the lower meridian, have a very
marked effect upon the character and destiny of the
person so born. These are empirical observations.
They can be tested, but, if tested, they must be so
in strict accord with the canons of Astrology, which
ascribe certain influences to each of the planets.</p>

<p class='c006'>These great circles again constitute planes of
direct and transverse polarity, and they are found to
follow the principle of the segmentation of the cell.
They serve a most important part in the determination
of sex. But this is a long and intricate matter,
and cannot be fully discussed in these pages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, by tracing the effects upon health, character
and fortunes produced (or indicated) by the transits
of the planets over these sensitive planes, astrologers
have been able to determine exactly what effects
are due to each, that is to say, what they signify in
the course of events. Ptolemy, Tycho and Kepler,
Newton, and others among the great astronomers,
have confirmed the ascriptions of the astrologers
from personal observation, but without in any way
contributing to the solution of the problem of their
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span>, presuming them to have a causative
relationship in human affairs, or of their status in
a scheme of universal symbolism. They have just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>left the problem where they found it, while confirming
the general claim of astrologers that there is
a possible means of a scientific method of prediction.
Astrologers make no claim to any degree of special
inspiration. They merely argue from like causes to
like effects, finding illustration of the law of periodicity
in lunations, transits, eclipses and revolutional
ingresses, which, being connected in experience with
a certain succession of events, are found to produce
events of a similar nature whenever they recur.
Astronomy gives us the periodic values of these
several factors, while Astrology supplies an interpretation
from experience. Nothing could be more
scientific or more satisfactory. I may now pass to
the citation of some remarkable instances of scientific
prediction.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h2 id='chap08' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eight'>VIII</abbr> <br> ANCIENT AND MODERN EXAMPLES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Among the earliest of the great readers of the
Symbolism of the universe was Thales of Miletus,
who during the sixth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> formulated a
true theory of the cause of eclipses, and proved his
theory by predicting the eclipse of May 28, 585
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> He founded the Ionic sect of philosophers,
which was distinguished for the profundity of its
speculations, to which his successors and pupils,
Anaxagoras, Anaximander, Anaximenes and Archelaus
so largely contributed. Archelaus became the
master of Socrates. Anaxagoras proved himself as
skilful as his Master in the use of the sphere and in
astronomical studies, for he predicted the eclipse
of the Sun which was seen at Athens in the first
year of the Peloponnesian War. From Thucydides
we learn that it happened after noon in the summer,
and that the Sun assumed a crescent shape and
that some of the stars shone out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir <abbr class='spell'>J.</abbr> Herschel has spoken of this eclipse as total,
but this cannot be, as the Moon’s apparent diameter
was less than that of the Sun, so that even where it
was central it would be but annular.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now of Thales it is recorded that he foresaw by
his reading of the symbols that there would be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>great dearth of olives in a certain year, and he
accordingly bought up all the stock of olives that
was on the market and chartered all the stalls, so
that when the dearth occurred he was able to sell
at his own price, and thereby made a great sum of
money. This was at Alexandria. He then went
to Athens and found the plague raging there. He
at once took the matter in hand and was speedily
successful in purging the city, so that the people
erected a statue in his honour to commemorate the
event. Seeing his end approaching and knowing
that it would be due to the fall of some heavy body,
if indeed he himself did not receive a fall, he thought
to circumvent the evil by taking necessary precautions.
To this end he retired to a field where he
established himself. Being thus far removed from
any buildings and himself in no danger of falling
from a height, he thought himself to be secure, and
looked forward to the time when the evil indications
should have passed by. But it happened that an
eagle, having secured a particularly fine tortoise as
prey, carried it aloft and sought for somewhat
whereon to break its shell. Seeing the bald head
of the philosopher and mistaking it for a stone, the
eagle promptly let the tortoise fall. Exit Thales!</p>

<p class='c006'>The general truth of the Hebrew records has been
abundantly established by archaeologists both in
regard to the Babylonian and Egyptian captivities
and the sojourn in the wilderness. Their prophets
were men skilled in the reading of the universal
symbolism, and they described events centuries
before they happened. Daniel so correctly portrays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the career of Alexander that the early
opponents of the Bible sought to prove, but without
success, that the prophet was describing what was
past instead of predicting what was in the future.
However this may be, we cannot get away from the
fact that the ruin and desolation of many cities
which were in a high state of prosperity in Daniel’s
time and for some centuries after, such as Moab,
Edom, Amalek, Tyre and Sidon, and Ammon, were
undoubtedly predicted. These cities were to be
blotted out. They were in existence in the first
centuries of our era, but now they no longer exist.
The subjugation of Egypt was clearly foretold and
has accordingly happened. Nineveh and Babylon
were condemned to desolation and utter ruin when
in the height of their prosperity. They were to be
places of eternal solitude, the haunt of wild beasts,
and the palaces a hiding-place for jackals. Daniel’s
famous prophecy of the coming of the Messiah after
Seventy Weeks, <abbr class='spell'><i>i. e.</i></abbr> 490 years from the time of
the going forth of the order to restore and rebuild
Jerusalem. The prophet clearly indicates the source
whence he was able to obtain initial light upon the
basis of prophecy, for he informs us that in the first
year of the reign of Darius (521 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>) he “understood
by books the numbers of the years,” etc. Thereafter
by prayer and fasting he attained great illumination,
but in all his prophecies, where he makes use of the
symbolism of Nature, he uses the day for a year
that is still pursued by the student of Astrology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coming to more modern times of which we have
closer record, we find in Michael Nostradamus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Physician to Henry <abbr title='the second'>II</abbr> of France and Catherine de
Medici, something of the same flame that animated
the ancient prophets. He carried his Astrology to
a fine art, and among his predictions are many that
deserve notice. The death of the King in a duel
is well pourtrayed by him in a stanza—</p>

<p class='c014'>Henry <abbr title='the second'>II</abbr> was killed by Montmorency on the
<abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> July, 1547, while engaged in a tourney at the
nuptials of his sister with the Duke of Savoy. The
lance of the Comte de Montmorency struck the gilded
vizor of the King and penetrated to the eye. A
tumour subsequently developed and the King died
of it. This is in agreement with the prophecy of
Morin, who in his horoscope of the King gave his
death from a hurt to the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nostradamus is also believed to have foreshadowed
the Fire of London in 1666 in the following
lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The blood of the just (spilled) in London requires
that it be burned by fire in Sixty-six.</p>

<p class='c006'>This prophecy is in line with that of the famous
astrologer, William Lilly, who was patronized by
King Charles <abbr title='the first'>I</abbr>, and whose works were collected by
Sir Elias Ashmole. Lilly so clearly predicted the
Plague and Fire in two hieroglyphics that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>subsequently arraigned before Parliament concerning
his more intimate knowledge of the source whence
he drew his inspiration. His statement contained
in <i>Christian Astrology</i> is that he founded his prediction
on the ingress of the aphelion of Mars into
the sign Virgo, which he affirmed was the ruler of
the Monarchy then reigning.</p>

<table class='table0'>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'>Therefore in about four years from the time of
the Fire the aphelion of Mars would enter the sign
Virgo. Kepler’s Tables, which were current in Lilly’s
time, show the date of entry to be 1654, and a mean
of these shows the year 1662. Therefore, as the
hieroglyphic was published some years before the
events to which it refers, I think there can be no
doubt that Lilly has given us a true explanation of
his reasons for the prediction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kepler, the great Astronomer, not only affirmed
his belief in the principles of Astrology, but gave
illustration of them by his prediction of the rise
and fall of Wallenstein.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of Jerome Cardan, the astrologer and mathematician,
who compiled the Centiloquia of Ptolemy,
and made important contributions to the study
of Algebra, there is a remarkable story on record
concerning his prescience of his own death and the
manner of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>It appears that from a study of his own horoscope
he came to the conclusion that at a certain time he
would be in danger of death by human violence. He
therefore took precautions, and, having stored his
larder with sufficient material to see him through
the evil period, he securely bolted and barred all
the doors and windows of the house, and thus
thought himself to be in great security. But it
happened that a band of robbers passing that way
saw the house closed up, and, finding it to be very
securely protected, they fancied that some great
treasure might lay hidden away in it. They were
not long in breaking into the place, and, meeting
Jerome at the foot of the stairway, brutally murdered
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>John Dryden, the poet, studied Astrology very
carefully, and the excellence of his faculty may be
judged from the precision with which he predicted
the career of his own son Charles. Congreve gives
us the account very circumstantially. It is said
that when his lady was about to give birth to this
child, Dryden left his watch upon the table, instructing
the attendants to be very careful in noting the
time of the child’s birth. The event having been
carefully timed, Dryden computed the horoscope
and made the usual calculations. He was thus able
shortly to inform his lady that at eight years of
age the boy would be in danger of death by a fall.
If he survived this he would be again in danger
from a similar accident at twenty-three years of
age, but that should he yet survive then at thirty-three
or thirty-four he would certainly succumb to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the malefic influences which then had indication in
the horoscope.</p>

<p class='c006'>In effect it was seen that when the boy arrived
at the age of eight years he nearly met his death.
His father, being intent on going to a hunt, left the
lad at home with a Latin exercise, enjoining him
strictly not to leave the house until his return. As
fate would have it, however, the stag in breaking
away from the hounds jumped the wall of Dryden’s
garden, and the boy running out to see what the
noise was all about, came by the wall just as the
hounds were scaling it. The wall gave way under
the pressure of the pack, and Charles was buried
beneath it. After a long illness he was restored to
comparative health. At twenty-three years of age,
when descending the steps of the Vatican, he fell
and received such a severe blow upon the head as
to render him unconscious. From this, however,
he recovered, and might have lived to defeat the
sinister predictions of his father, but that at the
age of thirty-three he was tempted one day to indulge
in a swimming feat in the Thames. Having crossed
the river twice in succession he essayed to perform
the feat a third time, but being caught with cramp
or heart failure he was soon seen to be in difficulties;
and before assistance could be rendered he sank and
was drowned.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we see that among the readers of the Symbols
some were able to admonish others and to give
timely warning of the evils which beset them, while
themselves unable to provide against those troubles
of which they had equal prescience. One is indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>tempted to say with Philip Bailey, “Free will in
man is necessity in play.” But we know that the
reading of the symbols is not the same as the understanding
of the law, and it is quite reasonable to
affirm that the ability to foresee and predict a
danger does not carry with it the ability to avert it.
That such power lies to the hand of man we may
assume from the fact that successive rulers of ancient
China were able to continue in vigorous life long
past the age at which astrological indications
extend. Thus Fuh Hi reigned 115 years, Shin
Nung 140 years, while Hwang Ti lived 110 years
and reigned 100. Show Hao lived 100 and reigned
for 84, and several others lived over 100 years
each, and according to astrological principles all
the “arcs of direction” would be completed in
112 years. Thus Fuh Hi began the Patriarchal
Dynasty in 2943 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and the obliquity of the
Ecliptic was then 24° 7´, and taking the capital of
the Yellow Empire as in latitude 39° 54´ the product
of their tangents will amount to about 22°, which
added to 90° will give 112° or about the same
number of years.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we are also told that these men understood
the Tao-tien, or universal laws, and were in possession
of the efficacious Word, so that by their knowledge,
allied to their great virtues and simplicity of life,
they were enabled to withstand the assaults of
cosmical forces and extend their years beyond the
low average to which modern civilization has
brought us. It has been suggested by some controversialists
that the age of Methuselah, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>given as 969 years, should be reckoned as lunar
years, that is to say, as nine hundred and sixty-nine
lunations. But this would yield a period of about
78 years and 120 days merely, and by the same
computation he would be just over 15 years of
age when he begat Lamech, for it is said that he
was then 187 years of age, and 187 lunations equal
15 years and 47 days. But this would falsify the
whole of the chronology, which, although not established,
is found to be consistent in itself. Thus both
the Chinese and the Hebrews agree as to the date
of the Flood, 2348 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> At that time Noah was
the Patriarchal ruler in Chaldea and Yaou and Shun
were joint riders in the Yellow Empire. The
curious agreement of the Hebrew and Chinese
records is presumptive evidence of something in
the nature of a vast and probably universal cataclysm.
The following is the computation from
Genesis—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Age of Adam         at the birth of Seth,       130 years.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It is quite clear, therefore, that if we reduce the
natural years of Methuselah to lunar years the result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>would be to vitiate the whole of the chronology,
and, moreover, if we did so in regard to the years of
Methuselah we must also do so in regard to others
of the Patriarchs. This would mean that Mahalaleel
was born to Cainan when the latter was just over
seven year of age; or that Methuselah was born
to Enoch in the sixth year of his age! If there
is any improbability in the record at all, it is rather
in the idea of these patriarchal infants than in that
of the extreme longevity of Methuselah. If a mere
tortoise can live for 500 years, why not a human?
What the simple life is capable of, we of this age
have no knowledge from experience, but I see no
reason why certain souls, fitted by spiritual selection
for the performance of some great work or the up-holding
of a holy tradition, should not incarnate
under cosmical conditions which are also so select
as to withstand the concatenation of natural forces
which make for dissolution. At all events we have
here a rather interesting problem for the Eugenists,
who, basing their principles on purely physiological
grounds, are confronted and disarmed on every side
by these occult forces in Nature which they have
failed to take into account. While they base all
their calculations on physical heredity, the occultist
points silently but impressively to the fact of psychic
tradition, and in support of the occult position we
are able to point to a hundred cases of insanity
which can be specifically predicted from the moment
of birth and years before the symptoms of mental
disorder begin to manifest. A theory to have a
working value must include all the facts, and so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>as human genetics are concerned not the least
among these facts is that of the cyclic rebirth of
souls and the continual importation of new psychic
forces into the line of physical heredity. The study
of Eugenics should begin in the study of psychology.
We know, for instance, that progeny generated
during intoxication will probably turn out epileptic,
but that does not answer the question as to why
one soul rather than another should animate that
body. Yet out of a dozen horoscopes an astrologer
will unhesitatingly pick out any one that may
happen to belong to a body thus afflicted. This
fact should give us pause to re-examine the foundations
of our system of genetics. The secret of health
and longevity is not to be found on this side of the
spiritual equator.</p>

  <h2 id='chap09' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr> <br> A TYPICAL CASE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The ancient secret records embody a tradition
of the going down of Atlantis into the depths of the
sea after the perversion of a race of humanity whose
physical culture, civilization and scientific attainments
eclipsed anything of which we have modern
example.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Hebrew records give us the familiar case of
Babel, that achievement of human arrogance which
reached to the gates of the Sun. The great civilizations
of Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece and
Rome have gone the way of all things temporal.
In the modern endeavour to “beat the record”
there is an element of danger which is too lightly
regarded by those who have no knowledge whatsoever
of the forces with which they are playing.
These are not of the air and wave alone but of the
whole universe, as well spiritual as physical. Let
us look at the matter in the light of a modern
example.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have no record as to when the <i>Titanic</i> was
keeled, but there is certain knowledge that it was
launched on the <abbr title='thirty-first'>31st</abbr> of May, 1911 at Belfast, the
time being Greenwich Mean Time, 12.42 <abbr class='spell'>p.m.</abbr> The
ship was well-named, not only because it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>greatest embodiment of human engineering and
ship-building skill, a veritable monster of a modern
Frankenstein, but also because it was the embodiment
of human pride and daring. The Titans, it
will be remembered, were a race of giants, sons of
Heaven and Earth, who were hurled into the abyss
for daring to make war against Zeus. It is the
Greek story of the submersion of Atlantis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ambitious in design, colossal in form, and inclusive
of the very latest of modern luxury, this
floating city took the water for the first time at a
moment when the whole amphitheatre of heaven
was witness of indications of impending disaster.
I do not pretend to know what particular Master of
Wisdom it was who set Argo Navis in the heavens
as a symbol of all that maritime prowess with which
the world has grown wonderful. I only know that
in whatsoever horoscope a malefic planet occupies
that particular part of the heavens it stands for a
symbol of disaster by navigation. It is associated
with Cancer. Neither do I know who it was gave
to Neptune the traditional rule of the ocean, but
yet I find it a prominent and malefic factor in all
significations of shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we have said that the time of the launching
of the <i>Titanic</i> was effected under portents of disaster.
Let us go more closely into the particulars. At the
moment of launching the <abbr title='nineteenth'>19th</abbr> degree of the sign
Virgo was rising at Belfast with the planet Mars just
below the eastern horizon. The ruler of the horoscope
was Mercury, and we find it in the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> division
of the heavens, that part which has significance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>voyages, and in conjunction with Saturn, the
significator of delays, obstacles, obstructions and
collapse. Both Saturn and Mercury were opposed
by Jupiter. The Moon was in the “ocean” sign,
Cancer going to the opposition of Uranus, the symbol
of sudden catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most striking point is the ruler of the horoscope,
Mercury, in the House of Voyages conjoined
with the malefic planet Saturn.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Titanic</i> set out for Southampton to take up its
first commission on the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> of April, 1912, at 9.20 <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>At this time Cancer was rising, and the Moon
was therefore ruler of the horoscope. It is found
in opposition to the Sun and in square aspect to
Neptune in Cancer just below the horizon. Here
again we have the ruler of the horoscope just
separating from eclipse and applying to an evil aspect
with Neptune, the traditional ruler of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c006'>The leviathan left Southampton on its maiden
voyage at noon of the <abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> of April, 1912. At this
time we find the sign Leo rising, and the Sun, ruler
of the horoscope, in quadrature to Neptune in the
<abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> House, an indication of hidden dangers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus in every case we find the ruler of the horoscope
to be significantly and severely afflicted. But
that which was specifically indicated as regards the
<i>Titanic</i> was generally indicated by the position of
Neptune in the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> House (death) of the Vernal
Ingress preceding the event, whereat the Sun was in
quadrature to Neptune, and this indication was
repeated in the horoscope for the sailing from
Southampton on the <abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> of April.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
<img src='images/fig06.jpg' alt='Figure 6.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Among many notable passengers on board the
fated vessel, none was better known or more
generally respected than Mr. <abbr class='spell'>W. T.</abbr> Stead. He was
born, according to his own statement, on the <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr>
of July, 1849, “before breakfast.” The horoscope
which fits the events of his life is one set for that
date at 7 <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr>, and the above is the figure of the
heavens at that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here again we find the Sun, ruler of the horoscope,
in the significant sign Cancer afflicted by the opposition
of the Moon and the quadrature of Saturn, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>latter malefic being in the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> House, which has
already been defined as that of “voyages.” The
fateful planet Neptune holds the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> House in the
watery sign Pisces.</p>

<p class='c006'>The indications of a violent and unnatural death
are clearly defined by Ptolemy, who informs us
that when both the luminaries are afflicted by the
same malefic, or when each luminary is separately
afflicted, there being no assistance from the benefic
planets (Venus and Jupiter) the native will die an
unnatural death. Here we find both the Sun and
Moon in quadrature to Saturn in the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> House,
showing as clearly as anything can be, that there
would be danger of death in a foreign land or while
on a voyage, and that by violence. I have no doubt
at all that Mr. Stead met his death through a blow
upon the head, as there are evident signs of collision,
but none of suffocation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The horoscope is in other ways significant of the
main facts of the life of the great journalist. Five
planets in cardinal signs with Mars in the Mid-heaven
testify to the tireless energy, executive ability,
courage and daring for which he was remarkable.
This elevated position of the planet Mars always
denotes impulse and impetuosity, and it is similarly
placed in the horoscope of Kaiser Wilhelm, in whom
Mr. Stead would doubtless have found a congenial
spirit. It gives that “scorn of consequence”
which attaches to the enthusiast in every phase of
life, and tends greatly to produce the pioneer spirit.
With Gladstone, Mr. Stead shared the view that
“psychical research is by far the most important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>work that is being done in the world,” but no
astrologer would have recommended him to undertake
it, for with Saturn in the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> division of the
heavens afflicting the luminaries he could hardly
hope for success in that direction, and there is little
doubt that he was very grossly deceived by some
in whom he placed great reliance in this matter.
The trine of Neptune to Mercury would, however,
impel him to such subjects. <i>Borderland</i> was not
a financial success, nor was it much more than a
ragbag of fragmentary and ill-assorted evidence.
Julia’s Bureau was not a success either from a
financial or evidential point of view. No message
of warning came through from “Julia” to save
him from his death voyage. Let us accept the
suggestion that has been offered, namely, that he
was wanted elsewhere. It was still open to those
who were aware of the fact to say so, and thus contribute
one of the most striking pieces of evidence
for the operation in mundane life of extraneous
intelligences, which would have gone further to
uphold the claims of those who believe in spirit-guidance
than all the literature Mr. Stead lavished
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of the disaster we find the following
arcs of direction measured in the prime vertical to
be in operation—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Moon opposition Uranus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sun conjunction Uranus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moon parallel Mars,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>while the Moon by secondary direction, that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>accounting one day after birth for each year of life
and two hours for every month, was in 26° of Aries,
exactly the longitude of the catastrophic planet
Uranus at the time of birth!</p>

<p class='c006'>Compare this horoscope with that of the ill-fated
Captain of the <i>Titanic</i>. According to the local
record Captain Smith was born at Handley, <abbr title='Staffordshire'>Staffs.</abbr>,
on the <abbr title='twenty-seventh'>27th</abbr> of January, 1850. Here again we find
the luminaries in opposition to one another as in
the horoscope of Mr. Stead, and both are afflicted
by the aspect of Mars. The time of birth was
probably at about five o’clock in the afternoon,
when the planet Neptune would be in the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> House
and Saturn and Uranus in the <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr> division of the
heavens. Sixty-two days after birth the planet
Uranus had reached the Mid-heaven of the horoscope,
and on the day of the disaster Mercury was in transit
over the same point, while the great symbol of death
and destruction, an eclipse of the Sun, fell in 27°
of Aries on the <abbr title='seventeenth'>17th</abbr> of April, close to the Mid-heaven
of this horoscope and on that of Mr. Stead’s horoscope.
Further, the Moon at the birth of Captain
Smith was in the <abbr title='fourth'>4th</abbr> degree of Leo and on the day
of the disaster Uranus was transiting the exact
opposition in Aquarius 4. Moreover, at the time of
the sailing of the <i>Titanic</i> from Belfast to undertake
her ill-fated maiden voyage, the 5th degree of
Cancer was rising, and on the day of the disaster
Mars had reached this exact degree of the zodiac,
being in 4° 56´ of Cancer at Noon.</p>

<p class='c006'>No case that could be submitted more fully and
completely illustrates the folly of disregarding the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>symbolism of the heavens, or more forcibly accentuates
the need of human conspiracy in regard to
cosmical agencies. Man has harnessed some of
the most potent forces of Nature and has constrained
them to his service, but for some as yet undiscovered
reason he prefers to remain in ignorance of the laws
which relate him to his greater cosmical environment.
We have imagined that by controlling these
natural forces we have asserted our mastery over
destiny. The heavens from out the immeasurable
depths of space are the silent witnesses of our folly
and arrogance. The same stars that fought against
Sisera fight ever against the man who is ignorant
of the laws of the universe which condition him.
We are fated to the extent that we are ignorant of
those laws, and culpable to the degree that we
disregard those that we know. The sea, the vessels
that are afloat upon it and all their human freight,
are as nearly touched and as surely disposed by
interplanetary action and cosmical forces as are the
molecules of air and water that constitute the winds
and waves. Never a ship was keeled or launched
but into it were compounded the elements that
respond to the great heart-beat of Nature. That
man should use all his faculties to the greatest
possible advantage to himself and through himself
to the race at large, that he should put forth all his
powers in the effort to master the forces which
appear to be in conflict with him, would appear to
be his supreme duty and his highest guerdon. But
there is a more convenient and less dangerous way.
Instead of defying the forces of Nature he can make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>use of them, instead, of ignoring the laws of Nature
he can adapt himself to them. This is called the
covert agreement. It is the ancient wisdom, the
simple way, and those who anciently observed it
found it to be effectual for good. Those ancient
Britains who thought Canute to be so great that he
could set back the ocean tides were of that order
of Titans who would measure their strength with
the Almighty. We, who have understood the laws
governing the tides, have gained a mastery over them
by the simple means of adaptation. In this instance
we have adapted ourselves to Nature. It is possible
to extend the process to include the election of times
and seasons for any purpose whatsoever. Solomon,
who is regarded by the average man as an inconsequent
babbler of effete doctrine, affirmed that there
is a time for every purpose under the heavens. A
closer study of this doctrine of elections—as the
proper choice of time for specific purposes is called
in Astrology—would lead men to take a conscious
part in the conspiracy of well-doing, by the adjustment
of action to purpose and of both to astral and
cosmical conditions. This would be infinitely better
than “taking one’s chance,” and certainly more in
conformity with the spirit of true religion. But
before we can do this we shall have to instruct
ourselves more generally in the symbolism of the
universe and the reading of those symbols which
from the beginning were set and appointed to us
for “signs and for seasons, for days and for years.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A knowledge of cosmical symbolism and of the
facts of planetary interaction is that to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>science will inevitably be compelled, and which
sooner or later it will recognize as essential to a true
concept of the relations of man to his greater environment.
And when this system of Anthrocosmology
shall have been established, as assuredly it will be,
then will humanity perceive in all humility that God,
and not Britannia, rules the waves, and that the
planets are his agents.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h2 id='chap10' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='ten'>X</abbr> <br> THE LAW OF CYCLES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>It has already been shown that from most ancient
times the Law of Periodicity was known and expounded.
We find reference to it in the Vishnu
Puràna which deals with the great periods of cosmic
manifestation and activity, called Manvantaras,
and the corresponding periods of obscuration and
quiescence known as Pralayas. These are shown
to have an astronomical basis and to have been
directly related (<abbr class='spell'><i>a</i></abbr>) to the period of Precession known
as the Great Year of Plato, and (<abbr class='spell'><i>b</i></abbr>) to the inclination
of the Earth’s axis to the plane of the Ecliptic.
For whereas the Precession, from whatever source
arising, is found to be approximately 50´´ per year,
the diminution of the Earth’s axial inclination
is found to be 50´´ per century. Thus the Precessional
Year is 25,920 years, and the other
2,592,000 years in extent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if we multiply this latter period by ten and
divide the product by six, we shall have the dividend
4,320,000, which we have already identified as the
value in years of the Maha-yuga or Great Age.
This means that the entire revolution of the Earth’s
axis occupies a period which is ten-sixths of the
whole period of cosmic activity known as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Manvantara. Hence we have the series 1, 2, 3, 4
equals 10, and the series 6, 12, 18, 24 equals 60,
which we have already shown to be the basis of the
Yugas composing the Maha-yuga. This value of
60 has therefore a cosmical significance.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> It is
geometrically derived from the interlacing of two
equilateral triangles, commonly known as the Seal
of Solomon, and esoterically invested with the
symbolical value of the universe in manifestation
of Spirit (male, positive) and Matter (female,
negative), and also the Out-breathing and In-breathing
of the Great Breath of Life. Water
crystallizes at an angle of 60°, and the ancient
teaching of Pythagoras, Plato, Thales and other
Initiates, was that Water was the basic element of
Nature. By the elements they did not understand
the chemical elements known to modern Chemistry,
but the Four states of Matter, the Igneous, Gaseous,
Fluidic and Mineral, which have their correspondences
in the Four Principles of the human constitution,
Spirit, Mind, Soul and Body, of which the
first two are formless or immaterial, and the last
two formative or material. Thus we have the
higher trial of Intelligence, Life and Substance, with
their multiplex manifestations in the lower triad
of Consciousness, Force and Matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>For there is only One Intelligence, One Life and
One Substance, and it is with the manifestations of
these in the lower world that Science is concerned.
Wisdom has no other concern than to discern the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Unity in Diversity and to cognize all in terms of
the One Being.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig07.jpg' alt='Figure 7.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another very interesting cosmical cycle is that of
the Eclipse Period. The initial value of this is
18 years 11 days 7 hours 42 mins. 35 secs., being the
mean interval between an eclipse and its recurrence.
In three cycles the eclipse will have moved through
one sign of the zodiac, and in twelve times three
or thirty-six cycles it will have moved through the
entire zodiac and come again to the place of the
first occurrence. Then 18 × 3 × 12 or 648 years,
to which add one for the precessional increment
and obtain 649 years as the Eclipse Cycle, after
which the phenomena recur in the same part of the
zodiac.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus I find an eclipse of the Sun in June, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>
1277, and the same eclipse in June, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1926,
another in June 1295, which recurs in June 1944.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>We can hardly escape the inevitable harmony of
celestial motions when we note that the eclipse
which recurs every eighteen years, makes seventy-two
appearances during the entire period that it
takes to work across the Earth’s disc from its
first appearance in the Arctic Circle to its disappearance
in the Antarctic. Here we have four
times 18 equals 72, and 72 times 18 are 1296 years.
Thus, again, we have the cyclic period of 1296 years,
which we have already noted in connection with
cosmical symbolism. It is twice the eclipse cycle
of 648 years, after which the eclipses return to the
same part of the zodiac. It has not yet been shown
that there is any necessary connection between these
two periods, and it is therefore the more remarkable.
The average of Precession being 1° in seventy-two
years, it is, of course, quite easy to link the eclipse
period with the Great Year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, then, we have a veritable Phœnix which
renews itself after incineration in Heliopolis (the
City of the Sun), and although Eclipses may have
no cosmical significance, they may very well have
a terrestrial one, both causative and symbolical.
Take, for instance, the abscission of the Sun’s rays
which takes place at the time of a solar eclipse.
This affects only a small area of the Earth’s surface,
but quite sufficient to produce very remarkable
results when, to the known tidal influence of the
luminaries we add the violent and sudden change
in the electrostatic condition of the atmosphere.
Thus at the solar eclipse of <abbr title='seventeenth'>17th</abbr> April, 1912, I
registered a fall of 27° of temperature in the space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of one hour in London. Here the eclipse was not
at its maximum, and in no place was it total but
merely annular. If the effects are due to the
combined action of the Sun and Moon, the ratio of
influence being in regard to the Sun 30 per cent.,
and to the Moon 70 per cent. roughly, then it may
reasonably be supposed that when the Moon is
simultaneously in perigee, that is, nearest to the
Earth in its orbit, at the time of an eclipse, the
effects should be proportionately greater, and also
that they should be experienced in that locality
which coincides with the zenith position of the
luminaries at conjunction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such effects can be traced in the occurrence of
great earthquake disturbances, due, no doubt, to
an effort of nature to restore the balance of magnetic
action, the local fall of temperature being met by
an uprush of electrical energy from the interior of
the globe. Similar effects are registered in the
human body by the local application of ice, the
blood being finally determined to the affected
part. And if the whole Earth can thus be disturbed
by eclipse influence, so also must men be,
since they are compounded of elements which are
drawn from the Earth. Not only the waters, but
also all plant- and animal-life, as well as the solid
mass of the Earth itself, respond to this influence of
the luminaries acting in combination, and there is
little doubt that there is a tidal effect in the atmosphere
which proceeds from the same cause, and
which affects the course of the weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fact that volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>do not follow all eclipses, merely informs us that
they do not always coincide with a volcanic area,
but whenever they do so there are marked disturbances
directly attributable to the action of the
luminaries, and similarly the effects upon the
weather will vary in accordance with local conditions,
such as latitude, elevation, mean saturation
point of the air, etc. Those who have failed to trace
the connection between lunations and the weather,
have left out of consideration the effects due to
(<abbr class='spell'><i>a</i></abbr>) the time of the conjunction, and (<abbr class='spell'><i>b</i></abbr>) the Moon’s
position in its orbit at the time. The Metonic
Cycle of 6940 days or nineteen years, is another cycle
of considerable value, which informs us what effects
are due to the combined influence of the Sun and
Moon irrespective of their ecliptic conjunction.
The lunations occur in the same degree of the zodiac
every nineteen years. Any effects that may be due
to their influence can best be traced by observing
how they fall in regard to the positions of the planets
at an epoch such as the moment of a person’s birth.
For if it is found that the New Moon falling on the
place of Saturn in a horoscope of birth is followed
by certain privations in agreement with the nature
of the planet Saturn, and that similar effects are
found to occur nineteen years afterwards, then the
influence of the lunation as a factor in human life
is presumably established. And if to Saturn we
add the other planets, and also if we add the other
aspects, such as the opposition, trine, quadrature
and sextile, we shall be able to institute a series
of observations which depend for their significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>on the assumed value (causative or symbolic) of
the luminaries. Such effects are easily traceable,
and serve to establish the significance of this cycle.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cycle of Jupiter which is taken at sixty years,
assumes a significance only when we have proved
the fact of interplanetary action. This fact has
been established both astronomically and astrologically.
The planet Jupiter takes twelve years to
perform a revolution in the zodiac, and five times
twelve is sixty years. But Saturn has a period of
thirty years, and twice this is also sixty years.
Consequently, if the planets Saturn and Jupiter
are acting together from the same part of the
heavens at a given date, they will be together again
in the same part of the heavens at the end of sixty
years, with a small variation due to the actual
difference of their periods. This fact has proved
of astronomical value, inasmuch as it has enabled
us to estimate the disturbance due to their mutual
action in the orbits of both planets. The period
at which these perturbations would recur has
been estimated at 920 years by Laplace, who discovered
it. These perturbations form what are
called the Great Equations of the planets Saturn
and Jupiter, when calculation is made of their
longitudes in orbit. It may be useful to note that
at the maximum the disturbance of Saturn due to
Jupiter’s action is 49´, and that of Jupiter due to
Saturn’s action is 21´. As the discovery was not
made until 1786, it will naturally follow that all
calculations made from Saturn’s position prior
to the eighteenth century, when it was incorporated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>as a factor in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>, must be to
some extent at fault. As cosmic symbols these
planets, Saturn and Jupiter, have great significance,
and they were highly esteemed in the astrological
thought of the ancients.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jupiter, as the most bulky of all the planets in
the system, early claimed attention and took a
foremost place in the pantheon. We find him as
Jupiter-Ammon, as the Deva-pitar, Deo-pitar, and
Jupiter of the Indian and Roman theogonies. He
is found in the Sanskrit writings as Guru, the
spiritual father or God-father, as the name Deo-pitar
signifies, and also as Brihaspati, <i>i. e.</i> the Lord
of Increase or Expansion. Similarly, Saturn was
S’iva, the Destroyer, whose reputation for devouring
his own offspring is referred to in the classical
mythology of the Greeks. Thus Jupiter is Brahma,
the Creator, and Saturn is S’iva, the Destroyer.
Such a significance they are found to hold in the
concept of modern astrologers. When, therefore,
Jupiter is found in that part of the heavens which
is empirically determined to have rule over the
destinies of a country or people, there is found to
be a period of expansion and prosperity; but when
Saturn is thus placed the country suffers privations
and losses. Let us look at some of these instances,
as they have a direct bearing on the practical side
of our occult studies, and give to the Law of Cycles
an economic value.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have before me an Investment Handbook,
giving the dates of the highest and lowest records
of the various prices of Stocks during the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>fifteen years. The figures that I shall quote are
taken directly from this book, and I need hardly
assure the reader that the editors have no associations
with Astrology.</p>

<p class='c006'>From any astrological book dealing with the
influence of the zodiac published prior to the year
at which our observations commence, the reader
may extract the following information: Scorpio
rules Brazil, Sagittarius rules Spain, Capricornus
rules India, Aquarius rules Russia, Pisces rules
Portugal, Aries rules England, Taurus rules Ireland,
etc. In 1895-6-7 the planet Saturn was in the sign
Scorpio, and in 1898 Brazilian Stocks were at the
lowest price between 1895 and 1910. In 1898
Saturn was in Sagittarius, and Spanish Fours were
then at the lowest between 1895 and 1910, a period
of fifteen years. In 1901 Saturn was in the sign
Capricornus, but Jupiter also was there, and in
effect, we do not find any depreciation of Stocks,
but the reverse so far as India was concerned.
In 1903-4-5 Saturn was in Aquarius, and in 1906
Russian 4% and 5% Stocks were at their lowest
during the period under consideration. During
1906-7-8 Saturn was in Pisces, and in the following
year Portuguese Stocks touched the lowest during
a period of fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c006'>During 1909-10 Saturn was in the sign Aries,
and in 1910 Consols as well as Annuities were at
their lowest for a period of fifteen years. During
1911-12 Saturn was in the sign Taurus, and Irish
Land Stock is now (1912) lower than it has been for
the past seventeen years.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>These facts speak for themselves, and they show
that Saturn is the cause of depression, destruction
of credit and national prosperity, and loss.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cyclic law and that of periodicity are practically
identical. For what we trace as the periodicity
of phenomena, can be shown to bear a direct
relation to planetary cycles. Take, for instance,
the periodicity of Sun-spots. The years of maximum
frequency noted have led to the discovery of a
period of 11 years and 40 days. Many years
ago I published a statement to the effect that the
rents in the luminous envelope or photosphere
of the Sun would be found to coincide with the
occursions of the planets Mars and Jupiter. Since
then I have made further research, and I find that
the mean of the two periods of these planets is
11 years and 203 days, which is in excess of the
observed period of maximum solar activity by
163 days; but by taking the periods of Mars, Venus
and the Earth into account, we have a period of
11 years 40½ days, which is exactly what we want.
The Sun-spot period of 11·11 years is, therefore,
attributable to the combined action of the planets
Venus, the Earth and Mars, the mean of whose
cycles yields a period so exactly in conformity with
it. Probably the introduction of Jupiter and Saturn
to the equation would yield a climacteric every
fifth period. It is, however, of extreme interest
to note that the years of the maximum Sun-spot
appearance, 1871, 1882, 1904, 1916, 1927, are found
to be associated with important configurations of
the major planets: 1871, Saturn opposition Jupiter;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>1882, Saturn conjunct Neptune; 1904, Jupiter
opposition Uranus; 1916, Saturn conjunct Neptune;
1927, Jupiter conjunct Uranus. From this we
might conclude that the luminous envelope of the
Sun is acted upon by the planetary bodies when
they are on the same solar meridian. An ingenious
student of planetary influence, Prof. Corrigan, has
suggested that by regarding the solar disc as a
plane, and setting off the orbits of the planets from
the centre, the parallels of solar latitude tangent to
the orbits of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are those
along which the greatest Sun-spot activity is shown.
Thus he shows that at the latitude of 5° North
and South of the Sun’s equator, spots are produced
by the action of the planet Mercury on the Sun:
at latitude 6° those produced by Venus’s action are
seen; at 7° those due to the action of the Earth
and its satellite; at 13° those frequent spots due to
Mars; and at 48° those due to Saturn; while the
band corresponding to the orbit of Jupiter is
attended by the largest and most frequent display
of Sunspots. Hence the Professor is quite in agreement
with my original statement that Sun-spots
are principally caused by Mars and Jupiter. This
certainly upholds the original observation that Sunspots
are connected with the occursions of the
planets Jupiter and Mars, but it would extend the
period to 11 years and 203 days. The whole subject
is, however, in its infancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cycle of 265 years arising out of the periodic
conjunctions of Saturn and Mars, and marking
epochs of great political disturbance in those areas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the world associated with the signs of the zodiac
wherein the conjunctions occur, has already received
treatment in my former works, so that nothing
need be added in this place. For the benefit of
those who have not hitherto touched the subject,
however, I may give a single instance. Saturn
and Mars form their conjunction every two years,
during which period they move forward one sign,
the whole circle embracing about 29½ years, so
that they complete nine cycles and come to a conjunction
in the same part of the zodiac about the
same time of the year after a period of 265 years.
The last conjunction of Saturn in Aries was in
1910, and 265 years before this date takes us back
to the year 1645, when the insurrection under
Cromwell took place, and 265 years earlier, in 1380,
we have the insurrection under Wat Tyler. Similar
effects can be traced in the history of other countries
from the same cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old astrologers gave certain periods as the
Least Years of the planets, the Sun and Moon. In
the scheme of Ptolemy, which differs in some
respects from this enumeration, most of these
periods are represented and evidently have reference
to the orbital periods of the bodies referred to.
Thus the Moon has a period of 4 years, Mercury
10 years, Venus 8 years, Mars 15 years, Sun 19
years, Jupiter 12 years, Saturn 30 years, following
upon which modern astrologers have added Uranus
84 years, and Neptune 164 years. But by taking
the periods of the ancient planets only it is found
that they are all contained in a period of 120 years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and that the periods of those planets which rule
opposite signs, as Moon and Saturn, Mars and Venus,
Jupiter and Mercury, when multiplied together
produce 120, which is one-third of the degrees in
a circle, and is the basis of the Vims’ottaradasa
periods of the Hindu system, about which something
may be said in a subsequent section of this work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 id='chap11' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eleven'>XI</abbr> <br> THE TIME FACTOR IN KABALISM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Every system of Kabalism employs numbers in
a symbolical sense, and attributes to them a significance
as if they were causative factors. This is
legitimate from the point of view of a philosophy
that regards the Universe as Symbol. In such a
scheme every cosmical factor assumes a symbolical
value, according to its ratio in the sum of things,
and each of the planets may thus be symbolized
either as deities invested with attributes and virtues
of a distinctly human nature, or yet may be expressed
in terms of numerical values, quantities,
colours, forms, and sounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in all such systems the symbolism employed
must finally submit to a mathematical expression,
which, indeed, is the test of its truth, for as has been
very wisely said, we have reason to suspect all
statements of fact which are not capable of a mathematical
expression. In this connection the Time
factor becomes of the highest importance in Kabalism,
and since the matter lies in the region of debate,
something may be said in this place that may
prove of value.</p>

<p class='c006'>In my Kabala of Numbers and elsewhere I have
repeatedly pointed out the fallacy of those systems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>which ignore the cosmic factors, which alone give
symbolism its coherence. Nobody can reasonably
ascribe any specific sound or numerical value to a
planet, or any influence to any part of the heavens
or to any period of time without having regard to
some cosmical factor as the basis of the system
to which these planetary or time significations
belong.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet I find that such systems are all too prevalent,
and that in some glaring instances they assume a
factor as the basis of the system, and straightway
set about to argue it out of existence. Thus it is
stated in one small manual intended for the use
of those studying the mysteries of sound and
number, that it is “essential to have <i>an accurate
knowledge of the time of the rising of the sun</i> at places
on particular days,” and the “simple method” of
doing this, according to its author, is to “take the
sunrise from any reliable almanac ... and add to
it for western longitude at the rate of four minutes
per degree, and subtract for eastern longitude at the
same rate, and <i>you have the mean local time of sunrise</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>How far this is from the truth any tyro in astronomy
will readily perceive. Yet when the error
was pointed out to this would-be exponent of the
“Mysteries,” instead of being gratefully accepted
as a piece of good information which could be
utilized in future publications, the unlucky critic
was most thoroughly abused, and the matter being
finally referred to the authorities at the Greenwich
Observatory, it was clearly shown that the critic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>was right and the author of the “simple method”
wrong in every case. The repetition of these errors
in subsequent publications leaves one with no
alternative but to conclude that either the intricacies
of apparent local sunrise are beyond him, or that
their introduction into his simple method of expounding
the mysteries would undermine his market
by rendering the truth too difficult for popular
consumption.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having already given the correct method of
finding the local sunrise by reference to ascensional
differences, a process which involves nothing more
complex than adding two logarithms together,
(<abbr title='tangent'>tang.</abbr> of Sun’s declination, × <abbr title='tangent'>tang.</abbr> of the latitude of
place), from which we derive the ascensional
difference (sine <abbr title='logarithm'>log.</abbr>), and comparing the result with
that due to the latitude of Greenwich. I need not
waste space on the matter in these pages. But it
may be pointed out for the benefit of those who
wish to base their calculations of the planetary
periods and sub-periods on the correct value of
apparent sunrise, that the equation of time at the
rate of four minutes for every degree applies only
to meridian transit in Right Ascension, and has
no connection with the equation by ascensional
difference due to the latitude of the place. In fact,
to find local sunrise it is absolutely necessary to take
notice of “seasons and latitudes of places,” and so
long as these are ignored so long will the mysteries
of sound and number which depend on calculations
made from time of sunrise remain “hidden
mysteries” in fact as well as name.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>By way of illustrating the inaccuracy and futility
of the “simple method” of finding sunrise, I may
take an illustration that is actually given by its
inventor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For instance, the sun rises at Greenwich at 4.50
on the <abbr title='twenty-third'>23rd</abbr> April, 1912, and we want to know the
local sunrise at Epsom. All we have to do is to add
the equivalent of 0° 17´ (which is nearly one fourth
of a degree), 1 minute to that amount. The local
sunrise at Epsom is, therefore, 4.51,” which for all
practical purposes it is, since Epsom is on the same,
or approximate, latitude as Greenwich. But when
it is further said that the local time of sunrise is
4.48 at Newmarket on the same day, in the name of
holy Science we must demur.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sun’s declination at 4.50 on April <abbr title='twenty-third'>23rd</abbr> is
12° 24´, which, referred to the latitude of Greenwich,
gives an ascensional difference of 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 4 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 12 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>,
and to the latitude of Newmarket 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 6 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 0 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>,
the difference of these being 1 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 48 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>, so that if the
two places were on the same meridian the sun would
rise on Newmarket at this time of the year nearly
two minutes before it rises on Greenwich. But
Newmarket is 0° 24´ east of Greenwich, and therefore
it would further advance the time by 1 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 36 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>,
and taking the two factors into account we have for
latitude and longitude combined 3 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 24 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> by
which the sun rises on April <abbr title='twenty-third'>23rd</abbr> sooner than at
Greenwich, the mean time being some seconds before
4.47 <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr> Had a more northerly place been taken
it could be shown that the discrepancy is proportionately
greater, and in fact at the summer solstice the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>sun rises on Liverpool only 1 minute after it rises on
Greenwich, although the former place is 11 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr>
52 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> west longitude, or 2° 58´, while at York it
actually rises before it does at Greenwich.</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore I would urge that a kabalism that has
reference to the cosmic factor of the sun’s rising
would be more effectually serviceable than it is
known to be if regard were had to the truth. A
system that is based on error cannot be true in
its structure, and this fact will account for the
constant falling of bricks upon the hapless heads of
those who enter the portals of this pseudo-scientific
structure, where everything is at sixes and sevens,
making unlucky thirteens, and where you have
difficulty in distinguishing Hermes from Aphrodite,
on account of their exchange of clothes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Similarly, it is no use instituting a system of
Kabalism that depends on the position of the sun
at the birth of a person, and forthwith giving
illustration of the system by means of births that
are recorded in Old Style, which involves a difference
of ten degrees in the sun’s longitude. Yet I have
seen this done by sober-minded Kabalists, and
illustrations of it exist in current works on the
subject of Numerology. A system, of whatever
nature, must be consistent in itself and must
depend for its integrity upon a cosmical factor,
otherwise it can only be described as a conglomerate
of detached observations, which, being brought
together cannot by any chance lay claim to the title
of a system. In another section of this work I
shall be able to show what was the origin of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>various sounds attributed to the planets, and how
the Mantravidya of the Brahmins of India has passed
into the hands of Mohammedans and others, who
have exploited it for their own purposes without
reference to its origin. I shall also be able to show
the astronomical basis of the various periods and
sub-periods of the planets, including the famous
trims’amsha, or “four minute period” which has
played such an egregious part in the furtherance of
a popular delusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me here say that a Kabalism is not a mere
play upon figures, nor is it a system which arises
by necessity from our system of enumeration as
some have sought to prove. It is fundamentally
an expression of some cosmical law, whether it be
that of planetary periods, or other divisions of time
instituted by us from observation of certain cosmic
factors, or yet the laws of crystallization, which
involve the fact of form in relation to sound vibrations.
Thus we may have a lunar kabalism depending
on the numbers 4, 7 and 28, another of the same
nature depending on the numbers 3, 9, and 27:
another solar kabala which arises from the numbers
18, 54, and 72. If those who seek to show that
the decimal system was originated by the use of the
ten fingers, called “digits,” would only have the
patience to examine their theory, they would find
that the facts are entirely against them. For if
counting on the fingers reduced men to the decimal
system, this system should be prevalent among the
aboriginal peoples. It is, however, an ugly fact
for the theorists that the very first system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>enumeration that we come across is the duodecimal
system of the Chinese and the Hebrews.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place we find that the Chinese had
twelve signs or months, each of thirty days, which was
the antediluvian value of the year, afterwards rectified
(2355 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>) by the intercalation of seven months
in the course of nineteen years. The cycle of years
was twice 60, or 120, arising out of the employment
of ten roots and twelve branches. They appointed
four chiefs to command the four gates or cardinal
points and elected Twelve Patriarchs to govern local
affairs. The duodecimal standard was instituted
very early in the civilization of the Yellow Empire,
as is evident from the Canon of Shun, wherein
weights and measures were regulated by the Yellow
Tube standard. This yellow tube was nine-tenths
of a Chinese inch in bore circumference, and nine
inches in length. It contained twelve hundred
grains of millet which weighed twelve pennyweights,
two pennyweights going to the ounce, sixteen
ounces to the pound, thirty pounds to the quarter,
and four quarters to the hundredweight. Thus the
basis of the whole system of weights was regulated
by sound, for there were twelve tubes, each of the
same circumference but of different lengths, and
these being struck gave the twelve notes of the
Chinese musical gamut. The measures of length
and capacity were also regulated by these tubes,
and thus sound was at the root of all the Chinese
mensuration. The fact that there were twelve
sounds in the scale shows that the whole system was
duodecimal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The Hebrew system was also duodecimal, for we
find that they had twelve months in the year
answering to the twelve Gates of the Sun, such as
those of Gaza (Capricorn) and Hebron (Cancer),
which are mentioned in connection with the feats
of Samson, the original of the Greek Hercules and
obviously a Sun-god. The twelve tribes were formed
upon the basis of the zodiacal circle, and are so
referred to in Jacob’s last prophetic blessing, where
the sons of the Patriarch are distinctly associated
with the astrological portents of the twelve
Signs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reuben—Taurus, the first sign of the Hebrew
zodiac, connected with the constellation Orion and
the letter Aleph (Bull). This tribe has often been
associated with Aquarius, despite the fact that
astrologically speaking it is not a watery sign, but
belongs to the airy trigon. “Unstable as water,”
is a figure of speech that has no reference to the
astrological functions of the sign Aquarius.</p>

<p class='c006'>Simeon and Levi—Gemini and Cancer. The
Levitical sign Cancer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Judah—Leo, “the old lion,” couchant. The regal
sign Leo.</p>

<p class='c006'>Zebulon—Virgo associated with Argos, the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>Issachar—Libra, “servant of tribute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dan—Scorpio, associated with Serpentarius, “an
adder in the path.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gad—Sagittarius, the trooper. The sign of
Jupiter or “Gad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Asher—Capricornus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Napthali—Aquarius, associated with the Tree,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“who yieldeth goodly branches.” Here the “hind
let loose” should be “the spreading oak.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph—Pisces, “the fruitful vine by the well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Benjamin—Aries, “the wolf,” connected with
Anubis of the Egyptian symbology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the Hebraic system is found to be duodecimal
also, and we follow suit in keeping our
standards on this basis, counting twelve inches to
the foot, and twelve pence to the shilling. Indeed,
there can be little doubt that the ancients modelled
their conceptions and established their standards
“after the pattern of things in the heavens.” By
common consent they instituted the Four Quarters
arising out of the apparent motion of the Sun, in its
daily rising, culminating, setting and decumbiture,
and its apparent transit of the equinoxes and solstices.
By common consent also they had regard to
the twelve signs of the zodiac, and their corresponding
months, the lunar asterisms or stations arising
out of the mean diurnal motion of the moon, and
other points and divisions of time, such as the
syzyges and quadratures of the moon. All these
became standards from which all calculations were
made, and hence all kabalism, as derived from these
cosmic phenomena, has a basis in fact which can
only be appreciated when the cosmical factors
employed are fully understood and appreciated.
Hence I say that the time factor, in Kabalism is of
the utmost importance.</p>

  <h2 id='chap12' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twelve'>XII</abbr> <br> INVOLUTION AND EVOLUTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The symbolism of astronomy lends itself in a
most interesting manner to the great problem of
human evolution. In my opening chapter it was
shown that evolution is the natural reaction to the
process of involution. Logically we cannot speak
of evolution without taking into consideration the
fact of a preceding involution. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ex nihilo nihil fit.</i></span>
The potential of matter is measured by its latent
energy, and this latency is static Spirit Force. Matter
is the ultimate expression of Spirit, as form is that
of force. The material forms of the visible universe
are therefore nothing but concrete spiritual forces.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it would appear that there are two processes
going on simultaneously in any cycle of cosmic life,
and these are a downward spiritual involution and an
upward physical evolution. The two processes are
complementary, and possibly may be regarded as
taking place simultaneously, although in the Chaldean
account they are spoken of as distinct in point of
time. Jacob’s vision of the Ladder of Life depicted
angels ascending and descending simultaneously,
and these are the spiritual forces that are in continual
play between pure spirit and gross matter.
The great tidal influx of spirit towards the plane of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>materiality admits of a constant ebb and flow of
the life-wave, so that, although at the present stage
of the Great Cycle the tide has set back and is at
its ebb, carrying its burden of detached souls along
with it towards the region of spirituality, may yet
mark periodic incursions of the spirit towards the
material plane, such incursions being in the nature
of abnormal phenomena.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we have from the beginning of the Great
Cycle a double influx involving an interplay of
Spirit and Matter. In the process of manifestation
by means of differentiation, Spirit (the positive
or male potency) may be regarded as taking a
downward plunge on the left-hand side, while
Substance (the negative or female potency) will in
the same scheme take the right-hand side in its
progress towards manifestation on the material
plane. The Paramatma or Universal Spirit first
appears as Purusha, while Mulaprakriti or Root
Substance manifests as Prakriti. The ultimate
expression of Purusha is Prana (Life force) while
that of Prakriti is Prithivi (Matter). We thus have
the Father Spirit on the one hand, and the Mother
Substance on the other, manifesting eventually in
the multitude of forms of Living Matter. Spirit
Substance thus invests and is at the root of all
physical life, Force and Matter standing always in
the same undivided relations as do Spirit and Substance
in the Archetypal World.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such mysteries concerning the origin of things
can be read in the astronomical disposition of the
signs of the zodiac, where Leo is the symbol of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Father Spirit and Cancer that of the Mother Substance.
These descend along their own arcs of
involution through the planes of Buddhi and Manas,
which are the higher and lower aspects of Mind,
and in combination represent the potential and
evolved Hermaphrodites, denoted by the planets
Mercury and Venus, which are set over these signs
in the astrological scheme, and have relation to
the signs Virgo and Libra on the one hand and
Gemini and Taurus on the other. Thence the Great
Breath descends to the Kamic plane, manifesting
in the Body of Desire. This is represented on either
hand by the signs Scorpio and Aries. Next the
Spirit-Substance manifests on the Astral or Psycho-Physical
plane, which is symbolized by the planet
Jupiter with its signs Sagittarius and Pisces, and
finally precipitates in the material world denoted
by the planet Saturn and its corresponding signs
Capricornus and Aquarius, the symbols of matter
in the concrete and in a state of flux.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scheme may be reduced to a diagram as
on page <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In view of this statement of the occult doctrine
of the origin of the phenomenal world, we are led
to expect in the course of physical evolution, which
is another name for the process of spiritual unfoldment,
that matter will yield continually new
characteristics, which now lie <i>in obscuro</i> or latency.
For spirit is now shaking itself free of the trammels
of matter, organisms are becoming more and more
subject and responsive to the impulses of the mind,
and matter is everywhere giving way to the effort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of a spiritual expression. The world has passed the
zero point of greatest materiality and darkness,
and though the mass of mankind are as yet only on
the plane of Kama, actuated solely by the force of
their desires and material appetites, yet quite a
large section of the world’s population is coming
under the direct influence of the Manasic forces,
and the demand for knowledge is being met upon
every side. Some few of the more advanced pioneers
of the race are functioning in the light of the Buddhic
plane and are overshadowed by the spirit. At the
head of all this Earth’s humanity is the supreme
Arhat, the Adam Kadmon of the Kabalists, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Iswara of the Hindus, the Jehovah of the
Hebrews.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig08.jpg' alt='Figure 8.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 8.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What is going on in this world is happening also
in others of the solar system, and over all is the
Supreme Logos, Brahma-Vach, the Ancient of
Days, whom we call the Lord. These are co-ordinating
Centres of Intelligence and Power functioning
in their respective spheres and on their
several planes as the various nervous ganglia in
the body of man, all being finally linked up to one
Centre in whom resides the consciousness of the
I AM, as planets are united to their central Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>And what we argue in regard to the constitution
of the Universe we also affirm to be true regarding
man, the Microcosm and epitome of the Universe.
He is one of those angels “ascending and descending”
on the Ladder of Life. For the purposes of
illustration we may borrow a symbol from the
astronomer, that of the elliptical orbit of the Earth.
Let the Earth represent the spiritual monad which
in process of involution has become associated with
material conditions of life, and is now an imprisoned
soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>It answers to the gravitational pull of the material
sun and revolves around it, chained by its material
desires, yet enlarging its orbit as it advances in its
evolution. The point where the planet passes its
quadrature, corresponds to the event of incarnation,
its lower apsis being the point of greatest physical
vitality. It passes out of the physical at the next
quadrature and for the remainder of its orbit continues
in the psychic or intermediate state between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the higher and lower worlds. At its higher apsis
the soul is in its supreme state of elevation, mingling
freely with other discarnate souls and those radiant
denizens of the higher spiritual world who are there
to minister to their spiritual needs. But when
the reaction follows and the desire for earth-life
again asserts itself, the soul responds to the gravitational
pull of the material sun and falls again into
incarnation.</p>

<p class='c006'>There comes a time, however, when by its peregrinations
in the sphere of the lower world, the soul
gains knowledge of real values, and the awakening
spirit, shaking free from the bonds of the flesh,
answers to the gravitational pull of a higher or
more interior Spiritual Sun which occupies the
kenofocus of the great ellipse. Such a soul passes
directly through the intermediate world into the
World of Spirit, and thereafter revolves around the
Spiritual Sun, descending only at the lowest point
of its orbit into the intermediate world for the purpose
of spiritual ministration, its only intercourse
with the material world being normally through the
world of discarnate souls who are subject to incarnation.
The diagram presented on page <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>, may
assist the reader in following out the scheme.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not here laying down any final teaching or
creed regarding the peregrinations of the Soul,
though during a life of inward experience one gets
some definite idea of the general plan of these
things, but I am taking the position of a symbologist
who employs cosmical facts to convey spiritual
ideas, as one may use a figure of speech to suggest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>an analogy or convey an idea pertinent to the theme
of conversation. Everything is symbolical, and
things have no other meaning than that which we
confer upon them, as letters or figures which are
used to signal a meaning from one mind to another
as by a code agreed upon beforehand, although in
themselves these symbols bear no such significance.</p>

<p class='c006'>So in the Dhammapada it is said: “Mind it is which
gives to things their quality, their foundation and
their being,” to which Epictetus subscribes when
he says: “Men are disturbed by their view of things
and not by the things themselves,” and these two
views are at the base of Idealism and Quietism, as
we may learn from Plato and Laotze.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig09.jpg' alt='Figure 9.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 9.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would therefore have been equally true in a
symbolical sense had the Higher, Middle and Lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Worlds been called the Sun, Moon and Earth Worlds,
for these answer to the Spirit, Soul and Body of
man, and therefore to the worlds or states of being
in which they function. Also by the same symbolism
they may be called the worlds of Light, Twilight
and Darkness, answering to the three Gunas or
qualities of the Soul in the Hindu philosophy,
namely, Sattva, Rajasa, and Tamas. But the
employment of a purely cosmical symbolism gains
point from the fact that whatever may be our views
regarding these ultimate problems of life, they
must necessarily take form from the things of our
experience and find expression in terms of natural
phenomena, or so much of the Great Handwriting
as we may have mastered and can employ as
symbols.</p>

<p class='c006'>The argument from analogy is indeed strongly in
favour of the view that all spiritual truths have
their counterpart and illustration in the phenomenal
world, that there is a natural law in the spiritual
world, and that this law can only be interpreted in
terms of natural phenomena. But it is also permissible
to take the opposite view and to affirm
that there is a spiritual law in the natural world
and that this can only be understood and interpreted
in the light of the Spirit. Indeed philosophy tends
ultimately to the view that the mind of man is but a
centre of consciousness in the Universal Mind, that it
reflects the Ideas of that Mind, and that things have
no real existence except as products of mind. We
all recognize the fact that the idea precedes and
outlasts the form that embodies it, and that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>is no constant relation between the thing and the
thought of which it is an expression.</p>

<p class='c006'>This idea, applied to the subject of Involution
and Evolution, gives rise to the momentous thought
that the Archetypal Mind that holds the idea of
this universe and is its Creator, is under no contract
to complete the scheme of things. God is under
no necessity to finish His work. The Great Artificer
may at any time destroy his moulds! But long-suffering
Nature comforts us with the idea of an
infinite patience, and the human mind suggests
something indefinitely more steadfast than its own
caprice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile by the dim light of our minds we
grope our way among the scattered symbols, seeking
in them for some intelligible answer to our questionings,
hoping to find in them, when all are understood,
a solution of the problem of the human soul.
Science, philosophy and religion all assure us that
we have reasonable hope, if not indeed the definite
promise of eventual success.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h2 id='chap13' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr> <br> PLANETARY NUMBERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In a section of my work on the Kabala of
Numbers I gave the planetary numbers as they
have been handed down to us, and my authority
in that case was John Heydon, who in his <i>Holy
Guide</i> has delivered the traditional values of the
planets, showing their correspondence with certain
numbers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am now able to cite another authority in the
person of Godfridus, who in the year 1650 published
a book called <i>Things Unknown</i>. Those who read the
book, should they be fortunate enough to obtain a
copy of this scarce old volume, will probably agree
with me that most of the information he has collected
is really not worth knowing, being in many instances
fanciful and misleading.</p>

<p class='c006'>But among other things he quotes the Numbers
of the planets and the signs of the zodiac. The
numbers as given by him are the same as those
given by Heydon, and for convenience may be
repeated here—</p>

<p class='c006'>Sun, 1 or 4; Moon, 7 or 2; Saturn, 8; Jupiter, 3;
Mars, 9; Venus, 6; Mercury, 5.</p>

<p class='c006'>Godfridus does not distinguish between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>numbers 1 and 4 attributed to the Sun, or those of
the Moon 7 and 2. It is important to know that
1 is the positive number of the Sun, and 7 that of
the Moon, while 4 is the negative number of the
Sun as 2 is that of the Moon. That is to say, if
the Sun is in an even sign at any epoch, or enumeration
is made concerning a male entity, whether
man or animal, the number 1 must be used, while
if the Sun be in a female sign, or enumeration has
respect to a female, then the number 4 is used.
Similarly in regard to the numbers of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c006'>These numbers have been exploited in several
books recently as if original with the author, who
indeed has gone so far as to claim for them the
authority of a Guru from whom he professes to have
received them. It is a fact, however, that they
have no representation in the East, neither among
the Shemitic people nor the Aryans, and they are,
as I have plainly stated elsewhere, traditional
among the Kabalists. The fact that Heydon
printed them and Godfridus also, and that these
books are to be found in the British Museum
Library, clearly indicates the source of inspiration,
and locates the Guru in this case as residing
solely in the fertile imagination of the author of
<i>The Mysteries</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Godfridus gives also the numbers attaching to the
signs of the zodiac as follows—</p>

<p class='c006'>Aries, 7; Taurus, 6; Gemini, 12; Cancer, 5; Leo,
1; Virgo, 10; Libra, 8; Scorpio, 9; Sagittarius, 4;
Capricornus, 3; Aquarius, 2; Pisces, 11.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a special significance attaching to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>order in which, these numbers are given, and it will
repay the astute reader to give the matter a little
study. I may here say that they were originally
attached to the Twelve Houses, and became associated
with the signs of the zodiac corresponding
with these Houses at a later date. They should
be studied in their prime significance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving this point for the time being, I would
point out here that these numbers have been used
in connection with the Signs by the author of
<i>Natural Law Versus Chance</i>, who shows considerable
faculty for painstaking research. Without referring
to the source of his information, he clearly shows
that the names of competitors may be enumerated
by means of this zodiacal gamut, and brought under
the unit value of one or other of the planets,
which, if ruling at the time, is capable of conferring
success.</p>

<p class='c006'>That which appears to vitiate the scheme presented
by him is the fact of his using the artificial
instead of the natural Hours, for if it be allowed
that the planets are associated with the days of
the week and that the quadrants mark the natural
divisions of the day, as from sunrise to noon, noon
to sunset, sunset to midnight, and midnight to
sunrise, then the Planetary Hours must be in terms
of these natural divisions, and, irrespective of the
season of the year and the consequent variation
of the diurnal and nocturnal arcs, there will be
six such “hours” from sunrise to noon, six from
noon to sunset, and six in each of the other quarters
of the circle. In fact, if “natural law” is to rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in the matter at all, it must be consistently carried
out, and artificial divisions of the day will continue
to befog the student of these arcana and prevent
him from getting at the truth of the matter so long
as they are employed. This putting of “new wine
into old bottles” has effectually vitiated both the
<i>Natural Law</i> system and that propounded in
<i>The Mysteries</i>. If any student cares to work out
the percentages of results derived from a strict
following of the rules as given in either of those
works, there will remain no shadow of doubt that
a good thing has just been missed, for lack of a
little regard to traditional usage.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the climax of inconsistency is reached in the
suggestion contained in <i>The Mysteries</i>, where it is
said that the planets Mercury and Venus are misnamed,
that Mercury is the antithesis of Mars
and Venus that of Jupiter, and that their numbers
are interchangeable! It is, in fact, calmly suggested
that at some remote period of history not named by
the author, the name-plates of Venus and Mercury
became detached, and as a result the one planet
was thereafter mistaken for the other! I can
imagine sober astrologers directing the planet
Mercury to a conjunction with the Sun for the
event of marriage, or predicting travels from the
conjunction of the Ascendant with Venus. In
effect we are asked to regard the signs Libra and
Taurus as the signs of Mercury, while Venus in
exchange takes Gemini and Virgo. This may not
appear so terribly inconsistent to such as are ignorant
of the disposition of the signs and planets as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>others, but I think that any one would jib at the
idea of Venus as the significatrix of travel and trade.
And when I speak of Venus in this connection I
mean Venus and not Mercury in disguise. Yet
one would have supposed that the very order of
the days of the week and the planetary sequence
from which it is derived would have given the
author pause to think. So far from that, however,
it seems to be set up as an unique discovery of the
utmost importance. It is time, therefore, that the
matter should be set straight, and the need for this
seems the more urgent since I have actually known
persons, intelligent and conservative of the truth
in these matters, but keen to follow up any new
clue, actually transposing the planets Mercury and
Venus in their horoscopes and willing to believe,
on the authority of an Occultist of some distinction
who in a weak moment was induced to write a
preface to the book, that the astronomers have
all been wrong for many ages, and that in following
the course of the planet Venus they were unwittingly
pursuing that of Mercury! The position
would be incredible were it not a fact in cold
print.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us proceed with the justification of the old
tradition. I have elsewhere shown that the planetary
periods bear a direct relationship to their sign
rulerships as determined by the ancients. It is
seen that six bodies, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
Mercury and the Moon, embrace between them the
circle of 360, each pair being divisors of one-third,
or 120° or years.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The pairs are as follows—</p>

<p class='c006'>Moon rules for 4 years, which divided into 120
equals 30. Saturn rules for 30 years, which divided
into 120 equals 4. These two are opposites, Saturn
ruling Capricorn and the Moon ruling Cancer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jupiter rules for 12 years, which divided into 120
gives 10. Mercury rules for 10 years, which divided
into 120 gives 12. These two are opposites, for
whereas Jupiter rules Sagittarius and Pisces, Mercury
rules Gemini and Virgo, which are the
opposite signs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Venus rules for 8 years, which divided into 120
gives 15. Mars rules for 15 years, which divided
into 120 gives 8. Venus rules the signs Taurus and
Libra, whereas Mars rules the opposite signs Scorpio
and Aries.</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be allowed as a basis for what follows.
The values and dominions are those traditionally
received through Ptolemy. The periodic values
of all the bodies of the ancient system are twice
the square of seven. The square of seven is 49,
and twice this is the value of the periods, namely
98 years. Students of numerology may pursue the
subject to its legitimate conclusion. I may now
proceed to establish this scheme by a series of
numerical tests which have been communicated to
me from India, and which I have remodelled for
the purpose of this demonstration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The harmony of the allotment of the numbers to
the planets and signs is shown in the following scale,
which, as will be seen, bear the numbers already
ascribed to them by Godfridus and others.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
<img src='images/fig10.png' alt='Figure 10.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 10.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This arrangement is traditional among astrologers,
and in very old works on the subject of planetary
dominions we find the following suggestive glyph,
which indicates that the mystery of the Pyramid
may be solved by reference to the elements of the
solar system.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig11.jpg' alt='Figure 11.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 11.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>It is stated that the perpendicular of the Pyramid
is the radius of a circle whose area exactly equals
the area of the square base. If this be the fact,
then we may conclude that the ancients successfully
negotiated the problem of “squaring the circle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The cyclic order of the planets according to the
ancients was thus: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun,
Venus, Mercury, Moon. This order is not haphazard,
as one might suppose who only knew the
order of the days of the week bearing the Planets’
names, or the apparent order of the planetary orbits
as seen from the Earth. There is nevertheless a
very good reason for this order, and it consists in
the orbital periods of the several bodies, that is,
the times in which they appear to traverse the
zodiac. Thus Saturn’s apparent period is about
30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 2 years save forty-three
days, the Sun one year, Venus about 7½ months,
Mercury about 3 months, and the Moon one month.
Applying the numerical test to this order, and
retaining as before the same numbers for each of
the planets, we have—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig12.png' alt='Figure 12.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 12.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If we begin the cycle with the Sun and follow with
Venus, Mercury, etc., we shall have a resolution
in terms of the Moon, thus—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
<img src='images/fig13.png' alt='Figure 13.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 13.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Again, if we take the positive Sun number and
the negative Moon number, we have Sun, Moon,
Mars, Mercury, 1295, equals 17 or 8, Jupiter, Venus,
Saturn 368, equals 17 or 8, and 8 plus 8 equals
16, which is of unit value 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the Kabalism of the numbers attaching to
signs of the zodiac clearly shows that the planets
Mars and Venus are natural opposites, and not
Mercury and Mars, as erroneously stated. The
following scheme will show that this is so.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Scorpio   9   opposed to Taurus     6</div>

      <div class='line'>Virgo  10 1     ”        Pisces 11  2</div>
      <div class='line'>Leo       1     ”        Aquarius   2</div>

      <div class='line'>Gemini 12 3     ”        Sagittary  4</div>
      <div class='line in11'>—                      —</div>
      <div class='line in11'>27                      24</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Equals 9 Mars           Equals 6 Venus.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The series begins with the signs of Mars and Venus
and concludes under those of Mercury and Jupiter,
the numbers attached to the various signs being reduced
to their unit values and added together, thus
yielding the sum of 27 for Mars and 24 for Venus,
which again are reduced to the unit values of 9
and 6, the numbers of the planets under consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Exactly the same result is produced if we begin

<p class='c014'>By making a sum of the values of the signs

      <div class='line'>Aries and Scorpio, the signs of Mars, values 7 and 9 equals 16</div>

<p class='c014'>Thus we have again 36, unit value 9, for Mars; and
42, unit value 6, for Venus. This scheme may be
reduced to a diagram, as on the following page.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we see that 9, the number of Mars, is opposed
to 6, the number of Venus, in whatever direction we
look, and the old legends of Venus and Adonis, of
Vulcan and Aphrodite, of Vishnu and Lakshmi,
most clearly point to this association of the planets
Venus and Mars in the minds of the writers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>mythology. As myths or veils they were intended
doubtless to hide something from the popular mind,
and initiation into the Mysteries consisted in the
interpretation of these myths in terms of cosmical
laws.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>Although it will be evident from the foregoing
illustrations that a very definite design lies at the
root of the allotment of numbers to the planets and
the signs of the zodiac, yet the study of the subject
would hardly be complete without some reference
to some other methods that I have evolved or that
are to be found hinted at but not expounded in the
writings of others. If, for instance, I were required
to demonstrate the fact that a certain method
underlies the planetary numbers, I could do so by
reference to the Kabala of the number 9, and
although in the process I might have to concede the
point that Jupiter and Venus are interchangeable,
I should still be warranted by my Kabala in affirming
that Mercury is not interchangeable with Mars, but
that it is polarized by the Sun, and that Mars is the
alternative or opposite of the Moon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this little Kabala, while itself very suggestive
and capable of many applications, has no cosmical
basis, and therefore may be the occasion of
much disturbance, if carried beyond its legitimate
domain.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is only necessary to take the numerical sequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and centralize that number
which answers to the planet whose opposite you
require.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus for Saturn, whose number is 8, we have the
sequence—</p>

<p class='c014'>So that having found the alternate of Saturn 8 to
be Sun 1, and that of Venus 6 to be Jupiter 3, of
the Moon 7 to be 2, it is quite easy to jump to the
conclusion that the alternate of Mars 9 must be
Mercury 5, and yet to get side-tracked on the very
first trip. For observe what happens in the resolution

may be reduced and converted by Fire or the Will,
neither consents to be converted. Herein is the
spirit of freedom that characterizes the fiery planet

now try Mercury, the universal resolvent.</p>

<p class='c014'>In antithesis we may set the number of the Sun
negative 4.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Here, by a curious refractoriness of disposition,
Mercury is seen to be resolvable only in terms of a
negative Sun, the number 5 being set in apposition
to 4. The obvious suggestion to those who are
engaged in the hermetic art, should they happen
upon this little kabalism, is that Mercury is the one
thing that we are able to convert into gold.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if we collect these resolutions we shall find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>that they are all in terms of Mars or the number 9,
whose position at the head of the scheme indicates,
as clearly as figures can tell us, that the Will is the
dominant factor in all human affairs.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in9'>Mars</div>
      <div class='line in11'>9</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Sun 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 Mercury</div>
      <div class='line'>Jupiter 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Venus</div>

      <div class='line in9'>Moon</div>
      <div class='line in11'>7</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Here we have Mars 9, Sun and Mercury 9, Jupiter
and Venus 9, Saturn and Sun 9, Moon (positive and
negative) 9. Moreover, it is seen that the sum of
Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, 4 plus 3 plus 8, is 15, and
that of Mercury, Venus and Sun, 5 plus 6 plus 1, is
12. Then 15 plus 12 are 27, and the unit value of
this is again 9. It is further of interest to observe
that the only planets that are not convertible are
Mars and the Moon, and that at the head and foot
of the scheme represent Fire and Water, symbols of
Spirit and Matter, the Will and the element of
Variability, one fixed and the other mutable. The
numbers of the Moon are 2 and 7, and these are equal
in sum to 9.</p>

<p class='c006'>To argue thence that we are justified in transposing
Mercury with Mars or Jupiter with Venus in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>system that has a cosmical factor for its basis is
to argue from cosmos into chaos. The planetary
numbers and those of the zodiac were affixed by
those who instituted the scheme, not from any
considerations of a fanciful nature, but on certain
cosmical principles which those who have thoroughly
mastered the subject of Numerology will find working
out in all astrological practice. It is, of course,
allowable to use numbers in a symbolical manner
after any order that may suit our purpose, but to
proceed from the time of sunrise by progression
through the planetary hours, and to violate the
established order of those hours by the introduction
of a fictitious interchange of factors, is an affront
to the intelligence of every astrological student and
a violation of the principles of cosmic symbology
that can only find its karmic effects in a condition
of mental chaos.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another kabalism which employs the planetary
factors has been in use for some time by certain well-known
students of interpretation, and is principally
applied to the predictive art. In this system the
planets hold the same numbers as those traditionally
allotted to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The signs of the zodiac, however, do not follow
the same rule, but take the values that belong to
their planetary rulers, as follows—</p>

<p class='c006'>Aries 9, Taurus 6, Gemini 5, Cancer 7 or 2, Leo
1 or 4, Virgo 5, Libra 6, Scorpio 9, Sagittarius 3,
Capricornus 8, Aquarius 8, Pisces 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>These numbers are combined with those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>days of the week ruled by the planets. Thus in
the case of a person born on a Tuesday in the month
of November, the numbers are both 9, for Tuesday
is ruled by Mars, whose number is 9, and in November
the Sun is in Scorpio, which again gives the
number 9. Hence those years in which the number
9 figures are regarded as important in the production
of great events.</p>

<p class='c006'>The months and signs corresponding are thus
valued:—January 8, February 8, March 3, April 9,
May 6, June 5, July 7 and 2, August 1 and 4, September
5, October 6, November 9 and December 3.
But it should be observed that, in order to keep in
touch with the cosmical order, these numbers are
only to attach to the first 21 days of each month,
the number for the succeeding month being used
for the last 10 or 11 days. Similarly, the day
counts from sunrise to sunrise according to some
authors, but cosmically it counts from noon to noon,
that period from noon to midnight being “the
evening” and from midnight to noon “the morning,”
as it is said in Genesis, <span lang="he" xml:lang="he"><i>Veyahi oreb veyahi
beqer yom echad</i></span>—“And the evening and the morning
were the first day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps one of the most interesting Kabalas is that
which has reference to the values of the signs and
planets when taken in combination. Each of the
months in the annual circle has a number attaching
to it according to the planet ruling the sign in which
the Sun is, as already shown above. This is multiplied
into the number allotted to the sign itself
apart from its ruler. Thus—</p>

<p class='c006'>It is then seen that the total value of the planets’
numbers is 65, while the total of the unit values of the

values and positions of the several factors, we
obtain results that are wonderfully harmonious and
suggestive.</p>

<p class='c006'>In connection with this symbol there is another

round it in the Chaldean order, the Sun being at the
highest point, thus—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It is then found that the Sun holds the unique
position of supreme elevation, while the “pairs of
opposites,” Venus and Mars, Mercury and Jupiter,
Moon and Saturn, are functioning on successively
lower planes.</p>

<p class='c006'>By starting with the first day of the week, Sunday,
at the point of the Sun and following the lines of
the Star, we shall derive the days of the week in
their order, namely, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. By reading from Mars
and taking every alternate planet, we get the order
of the atomic weights of the metals to which the
ancients ascribed these planets; namely, Iron,
Copper, Silver, Tin, Gold, Mercury and Lead. This
fact seems strongly to support the view that there
is a very real connection between the planets and
the metals referred to them by the ancients, for
while it is fairly certain that they did not know
anything about atomic weights, they very clearly
associated the celestial bodies with the primary
metals, and the fact that they are brought into line
through the apparent velocities of the several bodies
of the solar system seems to afford a suggestive
basis for further inquiry. We all are used to speaking
of the “golden” sun and the “silver” moon,
and we also speak in terms of cosmic symbolism
when we refer to an “iron” will, or of “steeling”
oneself against a danger, for Mars is the astrological
index of the Will, and the uses of steel and iron are
for defence and offence. In the name of Mercury
we have actually retained the ancient name associated
with the metal, although the root of it is <i>merx</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>trade, and has no direct associations with quicksilver.
But we pick up the link of connection
through the known association of Mercury with
trade and shipping, and when we see the winged
messengers or trading vessels carrying their burden
of foreign goods from one country to another, we
understand why Mercury was called the Interpreter,
for in astrology the planet Mercury is the symbol of
commerce, and it “confers the gift of tongues.”
Pliny says that copper was first discovered in Cyprus,
from which it gets its name, and, according to
astrologers from the time of Ptolemy until now, the
sign Taurus, one of the signs of Venus, rules Cyprus.
This sidelight is of interest, displaying as it does the
universality of planetary dominions. Copper, of
course, was in use before Cyprus had been named or
exploited, but it is of interest to observe that a
copper-bearing territory, which has given the metal
a name in the West, should be found both traditionally
and experimentally to be under the dominion
of the planet Venus, which the ancients associated
with that metal. Lead, which is named in connection
with Saturn, the Lunar alternative, has been
spoken of by some of the old Hermetists as a disease
of the Moon, and it is suggested that the “sick Lady”
took a bad turn at a certain point in her career,
and instead of appearing in shining silver robes, put
on those of leaden grey. It is worthy of note that
silver ore is frequently found in lead, and silver has
been successfully extracted from lead since 1829,
when Pattinson developed his useful process.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the above resolutions we have, as before, Mercury
in apposition to the Sun (negative), and the Moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in apposition to Mars. Now, to find a cosmical
basis for this order of things, we shall have to refer
to the “exaltations” of the planets as defined by
astrology. Thus, beside the particular Signs ruled
by the planets, there are others in which the planets
are said to be exalted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The exaltation of the Sun is in Aries, while that
of Saturn is in Libra. These two bodies are seen to
be interchangeable. The exaltation of Venus is in
Pisces, which is the Sign of Jupiter. But Jupiter’s
exaltation is in Cancer, which is the Sign of the
Moon, and the Moon has its exaltation in Taurus,
which is the Sign of Venus. Thus Jupiter and Venus
are rendered interchangeable through, and in the
period of, the Moon. The three planets, Moon,
Jupiter and Venus, have their exaltations in Taurus,
Cancer and Pisces, and these are ruled by Venus,
Jupiter and the Moon respectively. Mercury, whose
exaltation is Aquarius, a Sign of Saturn, is thereby
linked up with the Sun through the opposite Sign
Leo, which the Sun rules. A short study of the
following Table of Exaltations will make these interchanges
plain.</p>

numbers we may now consider that of Planetary
Sounds, these being an obvious connection between
Number, Form, Sound and Colour. Number underlies
all forms, all sounds and all colours, for modes
of vibration in the same universal medium give rise
to all of these. Thus it is said that the Logos or
Word gave existence to all living forms. Those who
have constructed Sound-forms by means of the
Eidophone will readily understand how all forms
may be derived from simple or complex sounds.
Sound is also related to colour, and there are those
who are sensitive enough to see sounds and to hear
colours.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we multiply this number 9 into the number of
the signs of the zodiac we shall obtain 108, which
gives us the key to the Ashtottaravàk or 108 sounds
of the Mantrasara. Let us look at the origin of these,
108 sounds, since they have been much exploited
without any specific explanation of their origin.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Indian Astrology there are 27 lunar asterisms
or Moon-stations which are each of 13° 20´ in extent.
It has already been said that the whole period of
man’s life is taken at 120 years, or an arc of 120°,
which is one-third of the circle, and by dividing this
by 9 we obtain an arc of 13° 20´, which is the extent
of a lunar asterism or Moon-station. These Moon-stations
were in great repute among the Arabian
astrologers, who attached specific influences to them,
but in the West they have been entirely neglected.
They still continue to form the basis of all Indian
calculations, and, as will be shown, are at the root
of the planetary sounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each asterism of 13° 20´ is again divided into four
padams or quarters each of 3° 20´, which is the value
of the Navamsha or one-ninth part of a sign of 30°.
Now since there are four amshas in each asterism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and 27 asterisms in the circle, there are 108 amshas,
and these correspond with the 108 sounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are five primary vowel sounds, and each of
these lasts for 24 minutes, or one Indian hour, which
is equal to 6° of the zodiac or one-fifth of a Sign.

compounds such as <i>oi</i> in “oil,” <i>ow</i> as in “now,”
etc., are produced from a combination of these.</p>

<p class='c006'>These five primary vowels range through the
several Signs and are taken up by successive consonants
attached to each of the Signs. These
consonants extend throughout the Signs to which
they are attached, as L through Aries, V through
Taurus, etc., so that the five Indian hours or 120
minutes during which Aries is in evidence, are related
to the five vowels in connection with the consonant L,
as Lah, Lee, Loo, Lae, Loh, and these are succeeded
by Taurus with the sounds Vah, Vee, Voo, Vae, Voh.</p>

<p class='c006'>By taking into account the five vowel sounds, the
consonants attaching to the various Signs, and the
relative positions of the planets at any given time,
a mantram may be formed which is in exact harmony
with the astral vibrations obtaining at that particular
time. Mantrams are also formed from the positions
of the planets at the time of a person’s birth. Some
of these mantrams are traditional with Hindu families

<p class='c006'>From this table we are able to extract the Planetary
Sounds, and for this reason I have called it a
Table of Planetary Sounds, for in the thought of all
astrologers a Sign infers a planet and a planet infers
a Sign. Hence as Mars rules the signs Aries and
Scorpio, we have the consonants L and N and the
five vowels, when sounded in conjunction with the
initial consonant.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it should here be remarked that the five vowels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>are not all attributable to Mars, although they are set
at the head of the Table under the sign Aries. They
merely characterize the five divisions of the Signs,
and are seen to range through the whole zodiac
from Aries to Pisces. They are associated with the
five disposers, or moderators as they are called,
namely, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be observed that I have eliminated some
sounds contained in the Sanskrit alphabet which
have no English equivalents, and also that in the
Table of Initial Sounds I have added some that are
allied to those found in the original, as for instance
Q and C (hard) under K, Z and X under S, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>An attempt has been made to fix the vowels under
the planets, but they are not found to be consistent,
and indeed it is not to be expected that they should
be, since the swara, which is constantly changing,
determines the vowel sound in force.</p>

<p class='c006'>As initial sounds the vowels U and O, having
affinity with the consonant W, may be classed under
Venus, A under Mars, since both are initial factors in
the scheme, and long I or Ee under Jupiter as related
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>to Y. But as I have said, when in combination with
the consonants, that is to say, when not initial,
they are in a constant state of flux owing to the
change of swara. Subject to this consideration they
may be added to the Table of Initial Sounds, where
they will be seen in the above scheme.</p>

<p class='c006'>The application of this scheme of Planetary Sounds
would appear originally to have been in the direction
of determining what sounds should be employed at
specific times in the construction of mantras appropriate
to the nature of the planet then ruling. They
were not originally associated with the signs of the
zodiac, nor yet with the planets ruling those signs,
but solely and specifically with the navamshas, of
which there are 108 in the entire circle, and as these
are connected with the asterisms through the Moon’s
motion, there can be no doubt that they had
originally a lunar basis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each of the signs is divided into 9 parts of 3° 20´
each, the order being as follows—</p>

<p class='c006'>Aries 0°-3° 20´ is under the influence of Aries
navamsha, 3° 20´-6° 40´ under the influence of Taurus
navamsha, 6° 40´-10° under Gemini navamsha, and so
on, the last 3° 20’ of this sign Aries being under
Sagittarius navamsha. The sign Taurus then
commences with Capricorn navamsha, and continues
on to Virgo navamsha, when Gemini sign commences
with Libra and ends with Gemini navamsha, and
is followed by Cancer sign which begins with Cancer
navamsha and ends with Pisces navamsha. Leo then
commences again with Aries navamsha and follows
the same course as the sign Aries. Thus nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>successive signs are used to designate the navamshas
of each 30 degrees of the zodiac, and so we obtain
the 108 navamshas, thus—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig17.jpg' alt='Figure 17.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 17.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But we have already seen that the lunar asterisms,
each of 13° 20´, are divided into four padams or
quarters each of 3° 20´, and as there are 27 asterisms
we have again the 108 amshas or subdivisions of the
ecliptic, which undoubtedly were originally associated
with the 108 sounds. The fact that these sounds
have come to be connected with the signs of the
zodiac is due to the affinity which exists between the
asterisms and the signs through their respective
planetary rulers. For it will be shown that the
Ashtottaradasha system of Planetary Periods (which
see) recognizes the procession of planetary influence
through the 108 padams in the course of 108 years,
so that each year comes under the influence of one
of these sections of the ecliptic, and the count in
each case is made from the position held by the
Moon at the time of birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>This subject of Planetary Sounds is of immense
interest, but inasmuch as it has been developed
solely along Oriental lines and has its basis in a
system which did not recognize the Vernal Equinox
as a starting-point, but found its yogatara in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>first point of As’wini (<i>Zeta Piscium</i>), I advise my
readers to accept with extreme caution the statement
that specific sounds are identified with particular
planets or signs of the zodiac, and more
particularly would I caution the reader not to rely
upon the application of these Initial Sounds to the
problems of speculation. I have merely shown in
this place how they are derived, and thus have no
doubt satisfied the curiosity of those who have seen
them in other books where they are given without
explanation, authority or warning, and stated as if
they had been experimentally proved.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>No records that are available to us serve to
determine at what period in the course of social
evolution the need for a week of seven days first
made itself felt, nor can we discover who it was
first invented it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Newton believed that Chiron was the first to
define the constellations of the heavens, and this
also was the opinion of the Greeks. But that is
to give to the mythical centaur a personal reality.
It is true that we may find him, along with his
contemporary Hercules, by whose arrow he met his
death, among the constellations, and if it be the
fact that the Greeks exalted their heroes to the
stars and shaped the constellations so as to record
their fame for ever, then we can only conclude that
Chiron did not define the constellations of either
Sagittarius or Hercules, whatever may have been
his part in the matter so far as the rest are concerned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is further to be observed that long before
the period ascribed to the famous centaur we
have mention of the constellations in the Book
of Job, where Arcturus, the Pleiades, Orion and
the Mazzaroth are mentioned. Both Homer
and Hesiod mention some of the constellations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>but it is known that Hipparchus, about 150 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>,
defined the limits of forty-eight of the asterisms,
while Ptolemy gave us a complete catalogue.
Some constellations have since been added by
Tycho, Helvetius and others. But from what
has already been said on this subject it will be
evident that the mythology and astronomy of
the Greeks was closely connected, but this does
not of necessity prove a Greek origin, for we have
yet to determine the origin of the myths. That
many of these are shared by the Assyfians, Aryans,
Persians and Egyptians, seems to show that they
had a Chaldean origin. The Chinese have an
astronomy which appears to be unique and without
parallel among other nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we go back to the earliest record, the Chinese,
we shall find that they had no week of days, but
a cycle of sixty days, and also one of sixty
years. But the days of the month were reckoned
from the Moon’s age, the day of the New Moon
being called the first day. Thus we find in the
earliest record such expressions as “the first day of
the first moon he brought things to a conclusion
in the temple of his ancestors,” and “on the first
day of the twelfth moon,” etc. Even the great
Confucius gives no hint of any week of seven days.
In his Chun-Tsiu he makes such entries as the
following: “In the fifty-eighth year of the cycle and
the third year of the reign of Prince Yiu Kung,
in the Spring, on the first day of the Second Moon,
the day being the sixth of the cycle (of sixty days),
the sun was eclipsed.” All his entries are of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>same careful and explicit nature, and expressed in
the same terms, that is to say, in reference to the
Cyclic year, the number of the month, the year of
the reigning Prince of Lu, and the day of the cycle
of sixty days.</p>

<p class='c006'>The earliest divisions of time among the Aryans
also follow the Sixty-year period, and the use of
the Tithi or Moon day is also to be found in the
earliest astronomical records. Nothing more, indeed,
is needed for an accurate record of time than an
Epoch, a cycle of years counted from that epoch,
the number of the last lunation, and the day of
the month counted from that lunation. The introduction
of a week of days is an adjunct that has no
special value in a time sense, and could only have
been the invention of a state of civilization in which
ceremonies and institutions of a weekly recurrence
were required to be indicated and fixed. We find
mention of the week, however, in Sanskrit writings,
as <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Somavar</span> (Monday), <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Kujavar</span> (Tuesday), <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Buddhavar</span>
(Wednesday), <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Brihaspativar</span> (Thursday), <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Sukravar</span>
(Friday), <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Sanivar</span> (Saturday) and <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Suryavar</span>
(Sunday), but there do not appear to be sufficient
grounds for fixing an epoch at which they came
into use.</p>

<p class='c006'>The days of the week as we have them appear
to be of Hebrew origin, and probably were derived
from the Chaldeans, for in the first place the appointment
of specific duties for the several days of the
week, culminating in the day of divine worship
on the seventh or Sabbath day, requires such a
division of time, and in the second place it can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>shown that the order of the days of the week can
only be accounted for by reference to the Chaldean
order of the planets, which, as has been shown, has
reference to their apparent velocities.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Septenary division of days, etc., is distinctly
Shemitic in its origin, and we find accordingly that
the system was extended by the Hebrews to a
period of seven years, and to a further period of
seven times seven years which was celebrated as
the Jubilee. The cycle of seven is not elsewhere
found. Western nations have done what they can
to break down this old institution by associating the
Sabbath with Sunday instead of Saturday, and by
celebrating the Jubilee at the end of fifty years
instead of at the end of forty-nine. But the teachings
of the astrologers and tenacity of the Jewish
faith have served to keep the astronomical and
religious aspects of this institution intact.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whereas we find difficulty in tracing the
origin of the week-days through any authentic
records, we have still more difficulty in ascertaining
the principles by which the first day was allotted
to the Sun, the second to the Moon, and so forth.
One cannot tell the day of the week by looking at
the sky or by taking into account any known astronomical
factor. But whatever may have been the
reason for fixing on a particular day as the Sun-day
and beginning the week with it, it has been adhered
to ever since, and, so far as we astrologers and
Kabalists are concerned, it is satisfactory to know
that it works out on empirical test.</p>

<p class='c006'>What are known as the Planetary Hours are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>derived from the succession of the days of the week,
commencing with the planet ruling and giving its
name to the day, and following the Chaldean cyclic
order. Thus on a Sunday the first hour is governed
by the Sun, to which follow in succession, Venus,
Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. On a
Saturday the first hour is ruled by Saturn, to which
succeed in order, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury,
Moon. Then as there are twenty-four hours in the
day and seven hours in the planetary cycle, the latter
will be contained three times, making twenty-one
hours, and there will be three hours still to run. So
if we begin with Sun on Sunday and follow with the
cycle through the day, we shall complete the third
cycle with Mars, and the twenty-second hour will be
the beginning of the next cycle under the rule of the
Sun, to which succeeds twenty-third Venus, twenty-fourth
Mercury, and the first hour of the next day
will be under the rule of the Moon, which will
accordingly be Monday, as shown in the following
tabular form, which may be extended at pleasure.
The planetary hours differ from the statute hours
inasmuch as they are divisions of the natural day
and night. The day is counted from sunrise to
sunset, and the night from sunset to the next sunrise.
From sunrise to noon is the space of six planetary
hours, and from noon to sunset six. Hence if the
day is fourteen hours long, each planetary hour will
be equal to one statute hour of sixty minutes and
twenty minutes beside, making 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 20 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> of civil
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seventh hour will commence at noon and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>last for eighty minutes, and the eighth hour will begin
at 1.20 and will also last for eighty minutes. The
foregoing table shows the afternoon or second
quadrant of six planetary hours on the <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr> of July,
when the day is found to be 16 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 28 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> in duration,
one-half of which is 8 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 14 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> One-sixth of
this is 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 22 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 20 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>, which is successively
added to Noon to find the beginnings of the eighth,
ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth hours. The last
hour thus begins at 6.52 and ends at 8.14. The
subdivisions of the hour are one-seventh of 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr>
22 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 20 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>, which amounts to about 11 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr>
46 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>, say 12 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> This being continually added,
from noon onwards, gives the beginnings of the
subdivisions of the Hour, as shown in the table.
In my <i>Kabala</i> I have shown the practical working
of these hours and Periods of the day so that there is
no need to repeat the process in this place.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may, therefore, be of use to the student if the

<p class='c006'>In a word, the characteristics of a letter or event
will be: In the hour of the Sun—Honours; that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the Moon—Changes; that of Mars—Strife; that of
Mercury—Business; that of Jupiter—Gain; that
of Venus—Pleasure; that of Saturn—Loss.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be observed that the use of the statute
hour in connection with planetary action has arisen
from the consideration of their universality, and an
equatorial scheme in which the Sun rises at six
o’clock approximately would thus yield a day of
twelve hours, and each quadrant would embrace
six hours of little more or less than sixty minutes each
in duration. But the application of the statute hour
to sunrise in high northern latitudes would appear
to be without adequate foundation, and in effect we
find that the results depending thereon are not consistent.
It is these inconsistencies, arising from the
introduction of new elements into the ancient scheme,
and the general neglect into which the whole subject
has fallen, that has given the impression that the
ascriptions are fanciful and the matter not worth
investigation. I know enough of the matter, however,
to warrant my calling attention to these
Planetary Hours as most worthy of close study by
students of celestial influence.</p>

<p class='c006'>A considerable field of research lies open to the
diligent student. It has to be finally determined,
for instance, whether apparent sunrise is to be
taken as the basis of the calculations or the true
Sun’s centre rising. The latter is not subject to
corrections for parallax, nutation, and aberration,
but depends on the rising of the Sun’s longitude on
the celestial horizon, the false horizon being ignored.
The celestial horizon, it should be observed, is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>90° from the Zenith. The formula for this calculation
is: Log. <abbr title='tangent'>tang.</abbr> latitude of place + log. <abbr title='tangent'>tang.</abbr>
Sun’s declination = log. sine of Sun’s ascensional
difference. For North declination add to 90°
and for South declination subtract from 90°. The
result is the semiarc diurnal of the Sun, and twice
this is the diurnal arc or the time the Sun remains
above the horizon. Convert to time at the rate of
four minutes for every degree and four seconds for
every minute of arc.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have then to determine whether sunrise is
the correct starting point, or whether it should not
be noon, as in agreement with the original Chaldean
conception of the division of the circle into
“evening” and “morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I may say that in my experience the count should
be made from sunrise, that the true Sun’s centre
rising should be taken, and that the Chaldean order
of the Hours should be preserved. I have also
found that the subdivisions play quite a minor part
in the determination of results, and that all events
falling within the limits of the Planetary Hour should
be found subject to the ruler of that Hour, and only
in a subsidiary degree to the ruler of the subdivision
of the Hour. I may now pass to a consideration of
another aspect of this interesting subject.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 id='chap17' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='seventeen'>XVII</abbr> <br> CELESTIAL MAGNETIC POLARITIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>It has already been shown by one of our Kabalas
that there is a certain polarity existing between the
planets of the system by which they become natural
antitheses and thus stand in certain relations of
polarity. Hence it is that the numbers attaching
to them are interchangeable. Thus it was shown
that Mars and the Moon, the one having its exaltation
sign in Capricorn and the other its rulership in
Cancer, the opposite sign, were numerical resolvants.
Also that Mercury, having its exaltation sign in
Aquarius, was resolved into terms of the Sun, whose
rulership is vested in the opposite sign Leo. Further,
that the Moon, having its exaltation in the sign
Taurus, was interchangeable with Mars, whose sign
is Scorpio, in opposition to Taurus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scheme of Planetary Hours involved the
whole of this question of Planetary Numbers, and it
was shown that the matter was open to considerable
controversy, necessitating prolonged observation
and research.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another point in connection with the
interchange of Planetary Numbers which requires
consideration. It is that of polarity. Astrologers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>everywhere recognize the fact that the signs of the
zodiac are alternately active and passive, or positive
and negative, male and female, and the Houses or
twelve divisions of the visible heavens are said to
have the same polarity as the signs with which they
are associated, as Aries with the <abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> House, Taurus
with the <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> House, and so on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, at a mean rate of motion, which is attained
at the equinoxes, the apparent transit of the Sun
through the Houses or divisions of the Prime
Vertical is at the rate of 30°, or the space of one
House in two hours. Therefore, if the Houses are
to be regarded as having the same polarity as the
signs they are associated with, then the first 30° of
the Sun’s diurnal arc will be negative in action and
the next positive, and so on alternately. But it
has already been empirically proved that the
quadrant from sunrise to noon is positive, that from
noon to sunset negative, from sunset to midnight
positive, and from midnight to sunrise negative.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a demonstration of this principle I refer my
readers to “The Law of Sex” developed in my
<i>Manual of Astrology</i>. This law requires that the
majority of influence exerted from the <abbr class='spell'>S.E.</abbr> quarter
of the heavens, which extends from the Sun’s
rising to its culmination, shall be positive and
tending to male generation, while that from the
<abbr class='spell'>S.W.</abbr> quarter shall be negative and tending to
female generation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it can also be shown that the Planetary
Hours, each of which occupies the time of the Sun’s
passage through one-half of a House, or 15°, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>alternately positive and negative. We then derive
the following useful diagram of the</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig20.jpg' alt='Figure 20. Polarity of the Houses.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 20. Polarity of the Houses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In this diagram the inner circle shows the polarity
of the Houses, whether positive or negative, the
next circle outward shows the polarity of the Hours,
and the outside circle shows that of the Quadrants,
which is summative of the Houses and Hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Applying this to the subject of planetary action,
it will be seen that a planet occupying the <abbr class='spell'>S.E.</abbr>
quadrant of the heavens will exert a positive influence,
but that its influence will be largely negatived
when it occupies the second half of the <abbr title='eleventh'>11th</abbr>
House in the course of its rising, and similarly, that
a planet in the <abbr class='spell'>S.W.</abbr> quadrant will exercise a negative
influence, which will be rendered more positive when
the planet comes to the first half of the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> House
in the course of its setting. The fact that male
horoscopes are generated from the <abbr class='spell'>S.E.</abbr> and <abbr class='spell'>N.W.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>quadrants and female from the <abbr class='spell'>S.W.</abbr> and <abbr class='spell'>N.E.</abbr>, goes
to show that these ascriptions are valid, and when
we further consider that human vitality is lowest
at the two points that are occupied by the negative
influence, and highest at those that are here shown
to be positive, should, in my opinion, go a long way
towards establishing this order in our astrological
scheme of things.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, if we consider the whole earth to be surrounded
with etheric vibrations and interpenetrated
by them, we may also legitimately refer these
vibrations to colours and sounds since all the forces
of Nature are interchangeable and convertible.
Such a conception lends itself at once to experimental
proof, and, as the result of researches carried
on during successive years by Carl von Reichenbach,
we have a definite scheme of colour attributable to
the different sections of the heavens. It is shown
that there is a form of electricity visible to persons
of a highly sensitive nature when placed in the dark.
In <i>The Sensitive Man</i> Reichenbach has given a mass
of experiments which show that the Od fluid undergoes
a variety of changes according to the magnetic
relations of the subject or object from which they
proceed. In the second volume there is a description
of the Earth-Aura. This is not, as one might
suppose, a composite of the various auras of its
geological constituents, but a thing apart and independent
of human, animal, vegetable and other
emanations. Every body has its own aura, and
these blend upon contact or within auric distance,
producing changes in the magnetic relations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>bodies concerned. The human aura is like that of
the crystal and has an obvious polarity. Thus the
auric colour at the head is blue while that at the
feet is dark red; the right side is grey-blue and the
left side yellow. Now this answers exactly to the
polarity of the visible heavens, for it is observed
that Blue, the most magnetic colour, is associated
with the North or midnight point; Red, the most
electric, with the South and mid-day; the neutral
to the East and the dawn; and the Yellow to the
West and sunset.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the body is laid horizontally, with the head
to the North, the colours were seen at their greatest
brilliancy, passing from blue at the head through blue
green to dark green, light green and yellow, golden
yellow, and orange to deep red at the feet. But the
most remarkable effect is that if the body be gradually
revolved so as to pass through the successive
points of the compass, a series of remarkable changes
take place in the colours of the aura, and the original
colours are no longer seen, but the blue at the head
undergoes successive changes by the admixture
of other colours according to the angle of deflection,
and in effect we have the—</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Colours of the Twelve Houses.</span></p>

<p class='c026'><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr>, Grey; <abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr>, Blue-grey; <abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr>, Blue with red
rays, Violet; <abbr title='fourth'>4th</abbr>, Blue; <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr>, Dark Green; <abbr title='sixth'>6th</abbr>,
Light Green; <abbr title='seventh'>7th</abbr>, Yellow; <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr>, Golden; <abbr title='ninth'>9th</abbr>,
Orange; <abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr>, Red; <abbr title='eleventh'>11th</abbr>, Violet-red, Purple;
<abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr>, Grey-red or dull Red.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Now the presence of a planet or of a group of
stars, such as enter into the composition of a constellation,
may reasonably be held to effect some
magnetic change in the radical nature of the vibrations
emanating from that quarter. The planets
are found to exert an influence on the magnetic
needle, and both Venus and Jupiter, as affecting
the earth in its orbit, may be regarded as instances
of the interplay of cosmical factors. The medium
by which the magnetic needle is affected by these
planets is doubtless the magnetic aura of the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The planets could, indeed, affect us through their
light rays if by no other means, for experiments
have shown that by directing the rays of Jupiter
and some of the fixed stars through a telescope on
to a selenium screen at a distance of ten feet, the
comparative effect was, of a candle light 1, of Procyon
0·261, of Cygnus O·262, of Aldebaran O·279, of
Orion O·685 and of Jupiter 3·272!</p>

<p class='c006'>Astrologically we are able to distinguish the
psychically gifted by the presence of the planets
in the lower meridian, but especially Sun and
Mercury, Saturn and the Moon. This answers to
the point of magnetic intensity at the maximum
which is registered about midnight, and this observation
leads to the conclusion that the planets do not
of necessity influence us by their direct rays, but by
the changes that they cause in the earth’s magnetic
aura at various points in the circle of the visible
heavens. Primarily the Sun must be the cause of
the normal magnetic aura of the earth, and the
planets would in this sense be moderators, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the old name applied to them by Ptolemy. Thus
the presence of several planets or the luminaries
in the lower meridian at the time of a person’s birth
will render that person particularly negative or
sensitive to the changes taking place in the auric
consensus of environment, and those who are in the
habit of classifying and collating horoscopes will
have abundant proof at hand that this is the case.
On the other hand, we find extremely positive people
to be produced by the presence of planets in the
<abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> House, near the South Meridian, and especially
such as have Mars (colour, red) reinforcing the
natural auric colour of that part of the heavens.
Two examples come readily to my mind, that of
Kaiser Wilhelm, in whose horoscope both Neptune
and Mars are in the Mid-heaven, and that of the late
William <abbr class='spell'>T</abbr>. Stead, in whose horoscope Mars and
Uranus are close to the Mid-heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>In effect we have the earth as the centre of a vast
kaleidoscope, undergoing changes of colour from hour
to hour by reason of the Sun’s passage from one
rising to the next. Obviously there can be no
universal red or blue since the Mid-heaven of one
place is the horizon of another that is 90° East or
West of it. Consequently there must be some
factor that produces local colouring, which at the
zenith produces vibrations which manifest as red
and at the nadir as blue. This factor must be the
Sun, since it is the only cosmic factor that has a
constant relation to any part of the earth at the
same hour each day. The planets in their courses
will then intervene to bring about modifications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the colours or vibrations instituted by the Sun, and
of these the Moon, as the quickest moving in its
orbit, will be the chief. Mercury will come next,
and then Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, so that
in effect we have the Chaldean order of interpretation
once more.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question then arises as to whether that part
of the earth’s aura where the Sun is at any moment
should not always be taken as the positive maximum
answering to noon and the colour red. If so, then
it follows that the time of birth becomes a very
important factor in the constitution of what may
be called the magnetic constitution of a person.
The whole subject is full of suggestions of the utmost
significance, but hardly at this date in a condition
to admit of dogmatic statement. The subject is
therefore better left for future consideration.</p>

  <h2 id='chap18' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='eighteen'>XVIII</abbr> <br> VULCAN THE CHAIN MAKER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>There is an aspect of Mars which has an interest
for us as prisoners in this house of flesh. Vulcan
or Hephæstus, son of Jupiter and Juno, is the
artificer of human bonds. By some he is thought
to be allied to Pluto, the god of the Infernos, and
in the Kabalistic conception, Malcuth, or the Earth,
is the lowest of the heavens and the highest of the
hells, being in fact in a state of equilibrium between
the Superior and Inferior worlds and therefore,
as Swedenborg suggests, it is in a state of freedom
from that circumstance. But can so much be said
of those that dwell therein? I doubt it. The
Oriental doctrine of Samsara pictures man as a
mere “Butterfly on the Wheel,” bound by the
chains of his own desires to the wheel of cyclic rebirth
into a world of suffering.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ye suffer from yourselves, none else compels,</div>
      <div class='line'>None other holds you that ye lag and stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whirl upon the wheel, and hug and kiss</div>
      <div class='line'>Its spokes of agony, its tyre of tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Its nave of nothingness!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The law of moral causation, as well as that of
affinity, impels man to rebirth while there are any
unexhausted desires in him. These unexhausted
tendencies are called <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>skandhas</i></span>. It does not matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>what we call them, we are all conscious of their
existence and of the terrible strife they cause in
us. These desires are in the Adamic nature, they
are in the human blood, and Mars is their cosmic
symbol. They are the chains of Vulcan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of Mars is nine and the magic of the
number nine haunts us from our birth to the very
last day of our existence in this world. In the
Kabala of Numbers I have shown the connection
between the Adamic race and the number nine.
This is the Iron Age, the Kali Yuga, and the horoscope
of the world shows the sign Aries, ruled by
Mars, in the ascendant. In the age of Saturn men
sought virtue and distinction in obscurity. Now
there is but one way to recognition and success,
Force and Self-assertion. Let those take it who
will. What is said of those who willingly take to
the sword may be applied to the slaves of every
other form of human passion. Mars will lay them
by the heel and bring them back to retribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cycle of nine is at the root of almost all the
mysteries of human life. It crops up in all the
astronomical cycles as if it were at the root of them,
and as representing cosmic energy (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Fohat</span>) and the
human will (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">Ichcha</span>) it manifests in all purpose
and all action, cosmical and human. For Mars
(nine) is desire (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">kama</span>) and desire is that which
underlies both will and action.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a period of cosmic activity which runs in
a nine-year cycle. It has even been shown that
meteorology cannot shake free of it. The year
1893 was a year of drought, rain being unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>from April to October of that year, and the summer
was exceptionally hot. The same may be said of
1902 and 1911, which are years falling in the nine-year
cycle. But 1894, 1903 and 1912 were wet
summers, and the temperature also abnormally
low. Dr. Goad, who studied meteorology from
the same standpoint of cosmic interplay, considered
that Mars was of chief importance in weather
predictions. Some people appear to think that the
icebergs on which the <i>Titanic</i> foundered are responsible
for the wet summer of 1912. I dare
venture the opinion that it was something many
degrees warmer than an iceberg. That icebergs in
the temperate zone have a tendency to condense
the air and so to produce rain seems reasonable,
but who loosed the chains that bind the icebergs
to the poles. Undoubtedly it was our Vulcan.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a scheme of thought that regards the whole
world as a symbol, and that is the standpoint we
are taking in this study of the cosmos, planets are
not necessarily causative but they are necessarily
symbolic. The symbol of humanity is the number
Nine, and this is the number of the planet Mars.
Hence we may say that for the present and during
the whole course of this age of the world’s evolution
or unfoldment, we are under the dominion of Mars.
The sooner we get into wireless communication
with him and understand some of his ways the better
it will be for us. For he is not only the maker of
chains but the breaker of them, inasmuch as he
represents both the Desire that fashions them and
the Will that looses them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Nine is also the cosmic factor. We have already
seen that the precession of the equinoxes is at the
rate of 1° in seventy-two years, and 30° or one sign in
2,160 years, the whole circle being completed in
25,920 years. All these numbers are multiples of
nine. Twice nine gives us the solar cycle, three times
nine the number of the asterisms, in six times nine
years the eclipses move through one sign of the
zodiac, and in 648 through the entire circle. But
this is nine times seventy-two, and so we find ourselves
again and again enmeshed by the network
of a nonal necessity. As the Old Philosopher truly
says: “Heaven’s net has large meshes, yet nothing
escapes it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Applying this magic of the number nine to some
of the deeper problems of human experience, we
may profitably examine the symbolism of the
asterisms, which are twenty-seven in number, or
three nines. The Hindus have a period which they
regard as the sum of life, extending to 108 years,
which is twelve times nine. From this we may draw
the conclusion that the Moon remains in one sign
for nine years and that this sign reflects nine others.
The system is connected with the Ashtottaradasha
system to which reference has already been made,
and of course, with the navamshas or ninefold
divisions of the signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have already seen that the ninth part of a sign
of 30° is 3° 20´, and that each such part corresponds
to a particular sign of the zodiac. This may be
seen in the Navamsha Table already given.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us suppose, for instance, that the Moon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>in the sign Leo 22° 43´ at the birth of a person.
By our Table it is seen that this corresponds with
the sign Libra, which navamsha extends from
20° 0´ to 23° 20´ of the sign Leo. Then in order
to find at what age Libra navamsha expires we
say—</p>

<p class='c006'>As 3° 20´ is to twelve months so is (23° 20´-22° 43´)
37´ to the answer. Now 3° 20´ is equal to 200´, so
that if we multiply 37´ by twelve and divide by
200, we shall have the months required, namely,
2·22 months or two months seven days nearly.
Therefore we know that the Moon is under the
influence of Venus during the first two months of
the life, and from Libra it passes to Scorpio, when
it comes under the influence of Mars, and then to
Sagittarius navamsha, where it is under the influence
of Jupiter. With this navamsha the limits
of the sign are reached, and the Moon in passing
into the sign Virgo comes first under the navamsha
of Capricorn which is ruled by Saturn, and from
Capricorn it goes into Aquarius navamsha and is
still under the influence of Saturn. And each
navamsha is one year, so that we know that the
period from two years and two months to four
years two months is evil, for Saturn is privation,
loss, darkness and death, and by the cyclic order of
things this will recur every twelve years, since nine
goes into 108 twelve times. Now it is a fact that
in the case cited the cyclic recurrence of this influence
of Saturn brought about at four years the death
of the father, at fifteen the death of the grandfather,
at twenty-seven the death of the mother, at thirty-nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the loss of all property. Similarly by this
system of the cycle of nine twelves, at the Moon’s
occursion into the navamsha of Cancer, which is
the lunar influence disposing to changes, and which
occurred at 8, 20, 32, and 44, there were radical
changes in life and surroundings.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any case can be worked out with perfect ease
from the Table of Navamshas, and will serve to
show that there is a veritable law of periodicity at
work in the lives of men. Not that all events or
periods recur at the end of twelve years as might be
thought by the impatient student from the examples
here given. On the contrary, it will be seen upon
closer study that Jupiter has a period of three years,
followed by one of nine years; Mars, one of five
years, followed by one of seven; Venus one of seven,
followed by one of five; Mercury one of nine years,
followed by one of three; and so on. But all the
planets recur eighteen times in the course of the
cycle of 108 years, and the Sun and Moon nine times
each. Then as there are five planets, Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, they will amount
in all their periods to ninety years, and the Sun and
Moon will amount together to eighteen years, thus
making the complete cycle.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Brihat-Paras’arahora there are many
systems of planetary cycles, employing the same
factors variously, and all of them symbolically,
since they do not depend on the true motions of
the planets in their orbits. Indeed, the ancient
writers appear to have devoted themselves very
closely to the interpretation of cosmic symbology,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and there are grounds which lead me to think that
some of their famous Nadigranthams or Books of
Destiny are built up entirely on a symbolical basis.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the most famous of these is the S’ukranadi
in which the horoscopes are written out for every 6´
of the ecliptic rising, making some 21,600 different
delineations. But in addition to this there are
purva and uttara, or first half and latter half,
subdivisions of each of the periods dealt with. The
planets are distributed after a certain order beginning
with the ruler of the rising sign, and this order
differs according to the consideration whether the
sign is cardinal, fixed or mutable.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this means a complete interpretation of the
permutations of the cosmical kaleidoscope is effected,
and from various of the readings that have been
submitted to me I am persuaded that there is
without doubt a great deal of truth in them. One
such grantham applies to all those who, whether
European or Hindu, were born between the Vindhyas
and the Himavats, but unfortunately, having other
engagements of a karmic nature, I find myself
among the large number whose horoscopes are not
contained in the kadjan. These monumental works
have hardly received the attention they deserve and
I am therefore collecting information with a view
to their analysis and study.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another very important subdivision of the ecliptic
circle is that of the Das’amsha or tenfold division
of the sign into amshas of 3° each. Applied to the
twelve signs we have as a result 120 divisions in the
circle, answering to the Vimshottaradasha system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of Planetary periods, notice of which has already
been made. In this system the amshas do not
run consecutively in the order of the signs of the
zodiac through the various signs, but follow
the order of the triplicities, known as the four
“Elements,” Fire, Earth, Air, Water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the Fiery Triplicity comprises Aries, Leo and
Sagittarius. The Das’amshas begin with Aries, and
the first 3° or amsha of Aries is ruled by Aries, the
first of Taurus by Leo, and the first of Gemini by
Sagittarius. The first amsha of Cancer is ruled by
Taurus, the first of Leo by Virgo, and the first of
Virgo by Capricorn, these being the Earthy Triplicity.
The first amshas of Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius
are ruled by Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius, these
being of the Airy Triplicity, and the first amshas of
Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are ruled by the
Watery Triplicity comprising the signs Cancer,
Scorpio and Pisces. The second amshas of Aries,
Taurus and Gemini are ruled by the Earthy Triplicity,
the third by the Airy and the fourth by the
Watery, the triplicities then recurring again in their
order. A study of the following Table of Das’amshas
will make the arrangement quite clear.</p>

<p class='c006'>The twelve signs of the zodiac which occupy the
first column are seen to be divided into four groups
answering to the four “Elements,” and the first
divisions of these groups are occupied by the four
Triplicities. These serve as entries or indices, and
from them the signs run on in their natural order.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who uphold the Vimshottaradasha system,
in which the circle is divided into 120 parts answering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to 120 years of life, will find their interpretations
from the occursions of the Moon into these amshas,
each of which answers to one year of life. Thus the
Moon remains in one sign for ten years, during which
it successively passes through ten sub-signs or
amshas, reflecting the nature of the planets governing
those amshas. It then passes into the next
sign and takes up ten influences successively, and
so passes to the next sign. Thus in one complete
circle of the zodiac it will take up 120 different
influences exerted by the several planets in the
various signs.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 21. Table of Das’amshas.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But each das’amsha or division of 3° is reflected
in an entire sign. Therefore each degree embraces
10° of the reflected sign. Thus the first 3° of the
sign Aries correspond with the whole of the asterism
Aries, using that term for purposes of distinction
only, and each of these 3° will therefore correspond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>with 10° of the asterism, and every 6´ will correspond
with 1°. Thus, if we take the first 3° of the sign
Aries, we shall find that they correspond with the
30° of the asterism Aries, and the next 3° of the
sign with the whole of the asterism Taurus, and so
on. Here are the first 3° of the sign Aries reflected
in the asterism Aries—</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be observed that in all these systems the
Moon’s place at the moment of birth or other epoch
is the basis of the calculation. The first of these
I have been expounding bears the sign manual of
Mars, inasmuch as it is a ninefold division of the
sign, and the latter system is accordingly one that
belongs to the Sun. The Hindus, who have many
methods of subdividing the signs, from two to
thirty divisions for each sign, have various uses also
for the different methods, but the object of them
all is towards an intelligent anticipation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>course of mundane events. In this direction the
West has also developed some methods, which, on
account of their simplicity, have found a certain
vogue among the Arabs, and are even at this day
exercising the ingenuity of reputable exponents of
the predictive art. They are called by the Arabs,
Alfridaries, and some examples of them are to be
found in <i>The Manual of Occultism</i>. Let us look at
some of the later evolved examples of the Alfridary.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 id='chap19' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='nineteen'>XIX</abbr> <br> ALFRIDARIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Perhaps the simplest example of the Alfridary
that we have received is that in which the Sun takes
precedence in all Day births and the Moon in all
Night births, the planets following the Sun in, the
usual Chaldean order, and the Moon in the reversed
order.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oldest that is known to us in the West is that
invented by Claudius Ptolemy in the second century.
It is developed in the <i>Tetrabiblos</i> or Four Books
on the Influence of the Stars, translations of which
are easily obtained, the best being that by Ashmand.
Under the head of Chronocrators, the Seven Ages
of Man, so graphically described by the bard in
<i>As You Like It</i>, are for the first time mentioned
and placed under the dominion of the seven planets
of the ancient solar system. Ptolemy’s invention
consists in ascribing to these ages the number of
years they extend, and applying to them certain
periods of the planets and luminaries. Thus he
makes the Moon to rule the first four years of life,
the infant “mewling and puking in the nurse’s
arms”; the next ten years are under Mercury, and
denote the “schoolboy, with ... shining morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school.”
The next eight years are under Venus, and represent
“the lover, sighing like furnace, with a woeful
ballad made to his mistress’ eyebrow.” The next
nineteen are under the influence of the Sun, according
to Ptolemy. The next fifteen under that of Mars,
denoting the “soldier ... bearded like a pard ...
sudden and quick in quarrel.” Jupiter rules the
next twelve years and represents “the justice ...
full of wise saws and modern instances.” Saturn,
ruling the next thirty years, figures “the lean and
slippered pantaloon.” Here the system of Ptolemy
ends, and to this the poet, with that prophetic
apprehension of ulterior need, adds a truly Uranian
picture of that “second childishness and mere
oblivion” which characterizes paralytic dotage.
Astrologers have sought to apply this system of
Chronocrators to the horoscopes of persons by taking
into consideration the aspects held by these planets
at the time of birth and judging of the period under
consideration accordingly. Thus a person at whose
birth Mars is an afflicting planet, as may be seen by
its aspects to the Sun, Moon and other significant
points of the horoscope, would suffer many troubles
and misfortunes during the period from forty-one
to fifty-six years of his age. One in whose horoscope
Jupiter is a beneficent planet, as judged by its aspects,
would similarly have good fortune and experience
many benefits during the period of Jupiter from
fifty-six to sixty-eight years of age. So in regard
to the other Chronocrators. The scheme is set out
in the following table—</p>

<p class='c006'>This may be taken as the foundation of a number
of ambitious attempts to read light into the
somewhat misty generalizations of the Alfridary.
One of these has regard to the Moon’s position at
birth, and employs the twenty-seven lunar mansions,
so much in repute among the Orientals, the periods
ascribed to the planets in this scheme being: Sun
10 years, Moon 9 years, Mars 7 years, Mercury
13 years, Jupiter 12 years, Venus 8 years, Saturn
11 years, making 70 in all, the planets following the
order of the days of the week.</p>

<p class='c006'>An extension of Ptolemy’s system of Chronocrators
seems to be a very feasible scheme, but to
give it more particular application to the needs
of the practical astrologer it is found necessary to
subdivide the periods allotted to each of the planets.</p>

<p class='c006'>For various reasons I should be disposed to adhere
to the period of 108 years, as being so uniformly
reflected in the cosmical order of things, and there
appears no reason why one planet should have a
longer period than another, seeing that in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>horoscopes the Moon may have the major influence
and in others Saturn or another planet, and hence
would dominate the life more particularly. While
it rules its influence is paramount, and that is all
that we can logically say of it. The attempt to
ascribe periods which are partly astronomical and
partly symbolical is at all events inconsistent, and
only invariable experience of their validity would
warrant us in accepting them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I propose, therefore, to employ all the known
operative factors of the cosmos, and to give to each
of them a period of twelve years, and since there
are nine factors, there will be 108 years in the circle
of life represented by this scheme. The Chaldean
order is adhered to, and the Period is ruled first
of all by the planet which heads it, and is followed
by the others in succession, or rather in rotation,
for that which rules the first subdivision of one
Period will be last in the sub-periods of the next
Period, as the following table will show.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Moon is seen to rule from 0 to 12, Mercury
from 12 to 24, Venus from 24 to 36, Sun from 36
to 48, Mars from 48 to 60, Jupiter from 60 to 72,
Saturn from 72 to 84, Uranus from 84 to 96, and
Neptune from 96 to 108. Taking into consideration
the known characteristics of the several planets (all
the bodies are regarded as planets from the point
of view of a stationary earth), these periods will,
I venture to think, appear as satisfactory as those
of the Ptolemaic method, while the inclusion of
Uranus and Neptune should render the system
complete.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>An objection which has been raised against the
Ptolemaic system of Planetary Periods, and which
on the same grounds may be raised against this one,
deserves consideration. It is said that it is extremely
unlikely that all persons are under the
same planetary influence at the same age. In this
I should concur were it intended that a single planet
entered into the equation. Such, however, is not
the case. For although all persons are under the
influence of the Moon at a certain period of their
life, and all of the same age are under the same
periodic influence at the same time, yet it must be
remembered that in the large variety of horoscopes
which arise out of astronomical changes during
even a single month, it is extremely unlikely that
any number of persons of the same age were born
under the same conditions, and in one horoscope
we shall find the Moon afflicted, in another well
aspected, and so on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Consequently, the Moon Period in these horoscopes
will be variously interpreted. For if the planet
governing the Period in force at any age is well
placed and aspected at birth, then the period will
be a fortunate one, and <i>vice versa</i>. Moreover,
the sub-periods involving the introduction of a
subsidiary influence into the Period will be interpreted
in terms of the aspect the sub-period planet
bears to the Period planet at the moment of birth,
and thus an infinite variety of interpretations are
afforded by the consideration of the various houses,
signs and aspects held by the planets in the radical
or birth horoscope.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Each planet then will rule in succession for a
Period of twelve years, during which it will bring
into play the conditions indicated by its position
and aspects at birth. The same planet will rule for
the first sub-period of that Period, and will be
followed by the other planets in Chaldean order.
Each sub-period will extend over one year and
four months, and will import an influence agreeable
to the nature of the planet ruling it, as well as an
influence in terms of its radical relations to the
Ruler of the Period.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus if at birth the Moon were badly aspected,
then during the first twelve years of life there would
be poor fortunes and changes adverse to the interests
of the subject. If Venus were in bad aspect there
would be sickness and family trouble at from two
years eight months to four years of age, which is the
Venusian sub-period of the Moon Period. Any
planet in the eighth sign from the Moon would
import danger of death in the family, and would
threaten the life of the subject himself during the
sub-period of such planet. Similarly a planet in
the second from the Period planet shows gain; in
the third journeys; in the fourth change of residence,
adversity to the parents; in the fifth benefits; in
the sixth sickness of the nature of the sub-period
planet; in the seventh adversity, rivalries, hurts;
in the eighth loss and death; in the ninth voyages
and foreign affairs; in the tenth honours; in the
eleventh new associations and allies; in the twelfth
bondage, restraint, anxieties, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would appear that all the Alfridaries in existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>are modelled upon the das’a systems of the
Hindus. In some of these the order of the periods
and sub-periods is regulated by considerations
of precedence established in the horoscope of birth,
but I have been unable to obtain any definite
information which will guide one surely to a correct
disposition of the various factors, and I have therefore
abandoned them in favour of one that appears
to me to have regard to cosmical symbolism, and
at the same time to include the application of considerations
of an individual and radical nature,
such as those obtaining in the horoscope of birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus every person born into the world is regarded
as a variant of the cosmical elements, a concrete
symbol in himself, born under horoscopical conditions
which are part of his greater environment
and related to a world of life in which, for good or
ill, he is required to function in terms of his own
nature. Hence the statement, which I hold to be
inviolable, that the planets affect us only in terms
of ourselves. The superman will have to be content
to take incarnation as he finds it. Without
lying idle on the shelf for some ages he cannot wait
for the stars in their courses to wheel into position
for the striking of the perfect die. In all ages and
nations there are such things as horoscopical misfits,
where the individual finds insuperable difficulty
in the way of perfect expression of character. But
if we all try to do our best in the circumstances
allotted to us, we shall give to the personal symbol
a new and a better value than it has hitherto
possessed. It is this fact of human perfectibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>that gives to astrological interpretations an ever
increasing interest. We see how the anciently
destructive forces of the planet Mars are converted
by human evolution into the executive ability of
the man of action. How the ostentation of the
Jovian plutocrat is changed to the benevolence of
the true philanthropist, and how even the mean
sordidness of the ancient Saturn becomes the constructive
carefulness of the social economist. And
from the remnants of this old universe of ours,
maintaining its cosmic integrity for ever, there shall
at length be evolved “a new heaven and a new
earth.” For as the expression of divine Ideation,
the universe is the revelation of God to man,
and this His handwriting in the heavens means
more than all the wisdom of all the ages has yet
deciphered. Cosmic Symbolism, of which here we
are only dealing with the crudest elements, will
hereafter come to be regarded as the subject of
man’s highest intuitions, the embodiment of a
perfected wisdom. Only when the last word of
the last chapter of the Gospel of Nature has been
read and understood will the heavens be rolled away
as a scroll and the Word be fulfilled which said:
“Behold I make all things new!” For our God is
in the making.</p>

  <h2 id='chap20' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty'>XX</abbr> <br> IN THE LUMBER ROOM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Almost every home has a lumber-room, a place
where all the out-of-date articles, derelict furniture,
oddments of all sorts, are stored. Nobody ever
goes there except the man who wants a bit of stuff
to fit something, one of those quaint little notions
that inventive men with time on their hands are
always at work upon. And almost every mind has
its lumber-room. The world has a huge depository
of this sort. Into this lumber-room of forgotten
things I would have you come with me, you who
are interested in odd ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Time was when the world believed that there was
an inherent relativity in things, and that nothing
existed for itself alone. That is one of the notions
that we have thrown into the lumber-room. But
as it fits my needs I will bring it out into the daylight
and have a look at it. The belief that is now current
in the world regarding the universe is that it is a
congeries of detached bodies, each existing for itself
alone, inhabited, maybe, or not inhabited, but
capable of sustaining life of some sort. There they
are, out yonder, but what has that to do with us?
Well, the old-world notion was that by taking a
dozen or so of pieces of wood of various shapes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>sizes and fitting them together you could make what
they called a chair. But nobody ever thought
either that the chair could make itself, or that the
shapes, as they called them, constituted a chair
without being fitted together. The fitting was the
most important part of the business. A man
picking up a shape would call it a chair leg or whatever
it might be, a back, thwart, side or seat. None
of them could be called a chair, but each of them
suggested it. Their use was in their relativity,
their interdependence, their connectedness. So it
is with the throne of God, which is the universe.
That ancient notion of relativity—you will find it
in the Mahabharata or that section of it which they
call the Sacred Song—was a good one.</p>

<p class='c006'>This earth of ours is a comparatively small planet
in a system of worlds. It does not exist for itself
alone, nor do those others which surround it.
Crude thinkers, without perspective, believed the
earth to be very big because it filled the eye. A
threepenny-piece will cover the Moon at arm’s
length. It is all a matter of proportion. But the
deeper thinkers knew better, and if they were foolish
enough to suppose that the planets existed for this
earth they also believed that the earth existed for
the planets, and they for one another. Interplanetary
action was believed in before Ptolemy
wrote his book on the Influence of the Stars, or
Kepler had framed his cosmic laws, or Newton had
found the glue to hold the pieces together. The
Carpenter had been at work before ever man opened
his blinking eyes to the morning sun, and what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>have called the Throne of God was made by Him
for His own use. It is ours to look and marvel.</p>

<p class='c006'>This notion of planetary interaction, the idea that
planets act and react upon one another, involves
that other which Science has not yet condescended
to observe, namely, planetary action in human
life. Tycho and Kepler, who argued things to their
logical conclusion, believed in it. Well, there are
books enough on the subject already for those who
would learn about it, and I do not intend to add
another to the number. But I would like to revive
an odd notion or two which even the dealers in
antiques, I mean the astrologers, especially the
modern ones, have relegated to the lumber-room.</p>

<p class='c006'>One may even be excused for believing that
planets, so nearly linked up with the destinies of our
earth, may have a direct action of a subtle kind
upon our lives and thought. But the idea that the
Moon’s Nodes may have such an influence is beyond
all saving, at least so think our modern astrologers.
Yet this was an ancient belief, and it survives at
this day in India and other parts of the world. But
then, you will argue, they are not bodies at all but
mere points. So is the actual centre of the Sun on
which the universe revolves. Your point is nothing—or
everything, as you will. I am not looking at
the bodies themselves but what they signify to us.
I am looking at the Universe as Symbol, I am
trying to get at its meaning. If the planets may be
regarded as symbols, so may the Moon’s Nodes.
They tried to give them a real existence as the head
and tail of the Dragon, the devourer of the Sun and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Moon. But this was for the popular fancy, as one
might put off a child with a fairy tale rather than
afflict him with a lecture on astronomy. They who
calculated the positions of the Sun and Moon and
predicted eclipses, knew how to bring the Dragon to
heel, and they knew his feeding times. They used
that knowledge to enslave a whole people, and haply
the same knowledge may help to set them free.
Nevertheless, they ascribed to the Moon’s Nodes a
specific influence in human life, or more correctly
a special signification. One could have affirmed
from a mere knowledge of this significance that
astronomy was first studied in northern latitudes,
for we see that the ascending node, that point at
which the Moon crosses the ecliptic in its upward
course, was regarded as fortunate, while the descending
node was unfortunate. And what they knew
of the southern climes was evidently not much, for
they called them Patala and Avitchi, and figured
the descent of the soul into the depths of a great
despair from the circumstance of the Moon’s
southern course. But all this was a symbolism
not invented by man, for he regulates neither the
Moon’s orbit nor its Nodes, and had no hand in the
making of eclipses. It was there for him to read, and
that is how he read it. Some astrologers say that
they were wrong. Others are more cautious. They
seem to have observed that certain periods in their
lives coincided with the transits of these Nodes over
the places of the luminaries, the Mid-heaven and the
Ascendant of their horoscopes, and they have made
due note of the fact, leaving the uninitiated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>decide for themselves by experience as to which is
the right way to hang up a horse-shoe for luck.
Yet among those who say it should be one way and
those who say the other, there are few indeed who are
aware of the fact that they are using the ancient
symbol of the Moon’s Nodes ☊ and ☋.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if the Moon’s Nodes have any symbolical
meaning and can be used for purposes of prediction,
so surely should the Nodes of the other planets,
whose influence, gravitation excepted, is quite as
great as hers. It is at all events just as well that
we should have them under observation, and so I
give them here.</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of this same lumber-room I can bring another
piece of neglected furniture, which possibly may suit
somebody’s convenience, for some men build shanties
out of old timber and others build theories out of
anything. Mr. William Lilly, whose patrons were
King Charles and the Great Reformer, Sir Elias
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Ashmole, and others of great fame, gave us the secret
of one of his most alarming and successful predictions.
Not that these latter are intended to alarm,
but to forewarn and admonish. He says that his
prophecy of the Great Plague and the Fire of London,
1665-6, was effected by means of the Aphelion of
the planet Mars, which he noticed was due to ingress
to the sign Virgo, that ruling the monarchy of
England in his day, about that time. Astronomy
was not a neat science in the time of Lilly, and he
wisely refrained from giving a date for the fulfilling
of his Prophetic Hieroglyphs, but he published them
so well in advance of the double event as to secure
himself against a possible margin of error in the
calculations. In a preceding chapter the reader
will find the calculation referred to. In effect
Master Lilly was called before the Committee of the
House of Parliament and there interrogated as to
the founding of his prediction, and what light he
could throw upon the matter. It is reported that
he acquitted himself creditably and was thanked for
his services. But mark you, Lilly said nothing
about the Horoscope of the Monarchy nor the
Aphelion of Mars, because doubtless he knew himself
to be in the presence of learned men who made laws
and not horoscopes, and whose business it was to
prevent plagues and fires, not to predict them.
But to the student of astrology he has very candidly
delivered his whole mind on the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now I have thought that if one man finds the
Aphelion of a planet to be effectual in producing or
indicating certain events in agreement with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>nature of the planet concerned, others may be able
to do the same with other planets, regard being had
to their Aphelia. Of course the whole thing may
be a bogey, and Lilly may be hiding his light in a
bushel. Commander Morrison, who was a clever
man and a good astronomer, sought to prove that
the Fire was due to the precession of the Bull’s
North Horn to the ascendant of the City of London.
The reader knows that since this entry of the Bull
into the City the herd has greatly increased, and there
are so many of them as to constitute another Plague,
were it not that they have let loose a host of Bears
to demolish them. Morrison’s idea is ingenious,
and works out to a fraction, but unfortunately he
did not predict the Fire and the Plague, while Lilly
did. Therefore I am bound to accept Lilly’s explanation
of his performance; and his reason appears
a good one, is in agreement with the facts, and employs
the astrology of the planet Mars in a consistent
and satisfactory manner. Further, I am
bound by that performance and that reasoning to
examine the effects likely to be produced by the
Aphelia of the other planets. Here is a statement
of their positions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Looking over these positions of the Nodes I find
one from which I can strike an Epoch at once. It
is that of Saturn’s Aphelion ingress to the sign Capricornus,
which is found to have taken place in the
year 1850. There are four countries which are ruled
by the sign Capricornus in which at this time there
were great upheavals, namely, India, Greece,
Mexico and New Zealand. India was engaged in
the Sikh War against the forces of the Moolraj, a
whole Bengali regiment was disbanded for mutiny,
and Sir Charles Napier shortly resigned the command.
Eight years of unrest followed, culminating
in the great Mutiny, and the rule of the East India
Company came to an end. Meanwhile Mexico was
engaged in a fierce war with the United States, and
the political convulsions ended in the resignation of
President Arista. Four Presidents succeeded one
another in the space of three years, and the country
eventually established a new Constitution under
General Comonfort in 1857. Greece at this time
came into conflict with the British and other
European governments because of its oppressions
and its non-payment of debts to foreign subjects.
Insurrections and blockades continued for some
years and a change of the Ministry eventually
brought about an agreement of neutrality under
the royal seal. New Zealand at the same time was
acting under the Charter granted to Sir George Grey
and founding new townships. In 1850, the year of
Saturn’s Aphelion ingress, the New Zealand Company
relinquished its Charter and a new Constitution was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>formed, which was in force from 1852 to 1857, when
it was modified.</p>

<p class='c006'>In every case the effects of such changes as took
place in these several Constitutions at this period
were, I think, exceedingly beneficial, and this is
what might be expected from the circumstance of
Saturn coming into his own territory, for Capricornus
is one of the cardinal or political signs, and is ruled
by Saturn.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the motions of the Aphelia are so slow that
many centuries have to elapse before a new ingress
is made, and this is hardly the way in which one
would seek to prove or disprove the symbolism of
such phenomena. One would rather consider that
the influence of the several planets is vested in
their Aphelia, and then observe what effects follow
the transits of other planets over those places, and
what effects are due to the direction of the Significators,
Sun, Moon, Mid-heaven and Ascendant, to
the places of these Aphelia in the prime vertical.
But I find myself talking the jargon of the astrologers,
as Lytton would say, whereas I am supposed to be
talking about Cosmic Symbolism.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig23.jpg' alt='Figure 23.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 23.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What are these Aphelia of the planets, and how
does their symbolism attach to us as humans?
The Aphelion of a planet is that point in its orbit,
or imaginary orbit—for we have already disposed
of the elliptical theory—where it is at its greatest
distance from the Sun. And if these planets
severally correspond with certain principles of our
human constitution, they may be said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>greater play and to be in a condition to exert more
of their own natures at such times than at others,
and proportionately less at other points in their
orbits, and least when in perihelion. For then those
principles and planets are enslaved to the Sun and
answer most fully to his all-embracing and compelling
influence. A soul that is in its most perfect
condition of physical manifestation may be said to
be in its perihelion, whereas one that has shaken
free to some extent from the gravitational pull of
the sun of this nether world, and has winged its
way into the outer regions of space, is to that extent
in a condition of temporary liberation. One is
almost tempted by this analogy to revert to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>symbolism of the elliptical orbit, and to place in its
empty focus another luminary or Spiritual Sun, such
as that conceived by Swedenborg, and to say that
these liberated souls are answering to the gravitational
pull of that luminary. The idea is fascinating,
both astronomically and symbolically, and since
the kenofocus of the ellipse is not under lease to
any of our scientific theorists, I will place my
Spiritual Sun in that centre of the empyrean and
complete my figure, as already exhibited in a
preceding chapter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we see what comes of rummaging in a lumber-room.
All sorts of suggestions and possibilities,
yet nothing perhaps that anybody would be willing
to bring back into daily use. These musty, time-worn
and out-of-date notions that nobody takes
much note of may some day claim the attention of
a Ben Hassam or somebody with a nose for things
of value, and a scramble for priority will be the
result. But alas! they have no market value.
Planets, principles, orbits, aphelia, and nodes, they
are all merely symbols in the everlasting Book of
Life.</p>

  <h2 id='chap21' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-one'>XXI</abbr> <br> THE LAW OF VIBRATIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In my <i>Kabala</i> I have shown that in the contest
between Chance of the haphazard sort which is
merely speculative, and that because it is grounded
in ignorance, and Law which proceeds by method
because it is based on cosmic principles, the latter
wins an easy victory, not once but always. I
showed that the divisions of the day and night that
we call Planetary Hours, whether they be artificial
or not, have a certain security from the fact that
they are founded on the cosmic order of planetary
velocities. It was also shown that certain numbers
answered to the several planets, and that these
numbers bore a definite relationship to sound
vibrations.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have received such a lot of correspondence
asking for further instruction along those lines that
I feel constrained, if only to gain some little respite
from my tormentors, to add a few pages here on the
subject of Chance reduced to Law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Without at all departing from the phonetic
evaluation of sounds as given in the Universal
Alphabet (<i>Kabala</i>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 30), it is possible to evolve a
number of methods by which the same results may
be reached, but I find none more satisfactory than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>that of the Law of Number and Vibration as related
to Planetary Hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has already been explained that Planetary
Hours depend on the length of the day, or the time
that the Sun is above the horizon, in any locality.
Take, for instance, the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> October, when the Sun
is above the horizon for some 10½ hours. On that
day the Sun sets in these latitudes at five o’clock,
and these five hours are divided into six Planetary
Hours, each of fifty minutes’ duration.</p>

<p class='c006'>These Hours, again, are divided into seven
Periods, each of which is governed by or related to
a planet, and these Periods will therefore be about
seven minutes in duration, since fifty divided by
seven yields seven and a fraction. Then for this
day we have the Planetary Hour equal to fifty minutes
and the Planetary Period to seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The usual mistake of those who have dealt with
the use of the Planetary Hour is that they divide
the whole time of the Sun’s diurnal arc by twelve, and
apply these Hours to the time of sunrise. This must
not be done. The quarters of the day must be dealt
with separately, the quarter from sunrise to noon
by itself, and that from noon to sunset by itself.
Six Planetary Hours are always completed at noon.
Thus on the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> October aforesaid, the Sun rises
at about 6.25, and consequently the time from
sunrise to noon will be 5 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 35 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> and this is
equal to 335 minutes, which being divided by six
yields the Planetary Hour for the first quarter of the
day, namely, fifty-six minutes. Then, again, we find
that the time of sunset is 5 <abbr class='spell'>p.m.</abbr> and this is equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to 300 minutes, which, divided by six gives the
Planetary Hour for the second quarter of the day
as equal to fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is very different to taking an average of fifty-three
minutes for the Hour and applying it to sunrise,
as the following comparative table will show.</p>

<p class='c006'>And if to these beginnings of Hours we add
successively seven minutes, being one-seventh of
the Hour of fifty minutes, we shall have the times
at which the various sub-periods begin. But it is
also necessary to affix the signature of the Planet
ruling the Hours and Periods, and for this purpose
we may note that the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> Hour is <i>always</i> ruled by
the planet that gives the day its name, as Mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>on a Wednesday, etc. The <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> October, 1911, was
a Wednesday. Also note that the first Period of
each Hour is ruled by the planet that gives its name
to the Hour, the rest following in the usual Chaldean
order.</p>

<p class='c006'>The table when fully set out will therefore present
the following appearance:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<p>Figure 24. Wednesday <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> October, 1911. Afternoon. Planetary Hours.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The reader will observe that in the periodic
succession the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> planet syncopates, and the next
Hour commences with the succeeding planet. This
is not so exceptional as at first it may appear, for
we have analogies throughout nature of the syncopation
of the octave. If you take a wire and stretch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>it across a bridge, as is done in the construction of a
stringed musical instrument, you will find that it
answers to a certain note when vibrated. At first
sight you may be disposed to think that the vibration
extends over the whole length of the wire.
This, however, is not the case, for on closer observation
you will find that at certain points along its
length the wire is quite stationary, while the rest
of it is vibrating. By placing the finger upon these
neutral points or nodes and again vibrating the
wire, you will find that they are the octaves of the
open note produced by the wire when in free vibration.
The following sketch shows the principle of
these neutral points or nodes. They correspond to
the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> planet in the series.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The vibration being the cause of what we sense as
sound, non-vibration must correspond with silence,
and so we know that the sound falls into silence and
re-emerges again in the higher octave of vibration.
This fact has an interesting application, which I
cannot develop in this place, but which the student
will take due note of.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having now got our Planetary Hours into array,
we are at once able to prove one or two of the occult
axioms, the first being that composites of sound are
reducible to numbers, and the second is that these
numbers when reduced to their unit values correspond
to one or other of the planets.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>By the use of the universal alphabet of sound,
known as the Phonetic Values, and which apply to
all languages the world over, we may take the name
of any person, animal or thing which is in evidence
at a particular time and prove that its name value
corresponds with the planet ruling the Period in
force at the time. Let us put it to the test once
more.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not know and should have difficulty in finding
the names of persons who met with some distinction
on the <abbr title='eighteenth'>18th</abbr> October in the year 1911, but I do know
that certain animals bearing distinctive names gained
distinction by winning races at Gatwick on that
particular day, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>faute de mieux</i></span> I will make use
of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first race was at 1.49. This was the Hour of
the Moon and the Period of Saturn. Therefore we
must look for the numbers 1 or 8. It was won by
Tucker—4222-10-1.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second event took place at 2.18, which is the
same Hour of the Moon and the Period of Venus.
We must therefore look for 3 or 6. The race was
won by Acsu—1266-15-6.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third event was at 2.48, in the Hour of Saturn
and the Period of Mars. We look, therefore, for 5
or 9. The event was won by Lespedesa—316814171-32-5.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fourth event took place at 3.15, which is the
Hour of Saturn and the Period of Moon. We must
look for a 2 or 7. It was won by Peristyle—8126413-25-7.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fifth event was at 3.46, which is the Hour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Jupiter and the Period of Venus. We must therefore
look for 3 or 6. The event was won by Wilfrid—63824—23—5.
This does not harmonize, but we
may note that Venus was in the sign Virgo, ruled
by Mercury—5.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last event was at 4.16, in the Hour of Mars
and the end of the Period of Mars or the beginning
of that of Sun. The latter gives us the number
4 or 1. The event was won by Gadfly—214831—19—10—1.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we see that without the slightest equivocation
or deviation from the principle of evaluation of
sounds already laid down, we obtain five direct
responses out of six tests.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us go on to the next day at Sandown, when the
day being Thursday, and the sunset about the same
time, the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> Hour will be ruled by Jupiter and the
beginnings of the Hours will be—</p>

<p class='c006'>The Periods can be filled in as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first event was at 1.30, and in the Hour of
Jupiter and Period of Saturn. We therefore look
for distinction to fall to one whose name is of value
1 or 8. The winner was Wild Duck—63422-17—8.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second event, at 2.5, was in the Hour of Mars
and the Period of Mercury. The number will therefore
be 9 or 5. The winner was Myriad—41214-12—3.
This is irregular, but it is seen that Mercury was then
in the sign Libra, ruled by Venus, negative 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The third event was at 2.30, in the Hour of Sun
and Period of Sun. We must expect 4 or 1 to win.
The event was won by Runnymede—2251414-19-1.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fourth event was at 3.7, in the Hour of Sun
and the Period of Jupiter. We look therefore, for
6 or 3. The event was won by Sobieski—6621621-24-6.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fifth event was at 3.38, and fell in the Hour
of Jupiter and the Period of Moon, but verging on
that of Saturn. The numbers of Moon are 2 and 7.
The event was won by Jessica—31621-13-4. This
may be regarded as an exception.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last event was at 4.2, in the Hour of Venus and
the Period of Sun. The event should fall to 4 or 1.
It was won by Pretiva—821461-22-4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here again we have four out of six results in strict
conformity with the rules of the Kabala of Numbers.
It is not necessary to go further in this demonstration.
Taking all the factors into account, the odds
against nine out of twelve events coinciding with
the requirements of the Law of Vibrations are
enormous.</p>

<p class='c006'>The practical use to which we could put such
information as this law affords, is in the regulation
of our efforts by the time factor. A person whose
name is of value 8 must not look for success in the
hour that is governed by Mars. He is sure to be
cut out by one whose number is 9 if it is between
sunrise and noon, or by one whose number is 5 if
it is between noon and sunset. Similarly at other
times. The putting forth of our highest powers is
of little effect in this sublunary world unless we do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>so intelligently and in agreement with the Law of
Astral Vibration. Moreover, a Mars man should
not concern himself with things that belong to
Jupiter, nor one under Saturn with those that are
governed by Mars. An aviator or motorist who puts
a number on his machine and sets it going in a
Planetary Period that is at variance with the
vibrations of that number, is asking for trouble.
Where there is danger of accident the Periods of
Mars and Saturn should be avoided, while those of
Venus, Jupiter, and either the Sun or Moon when
well aspected, should be chosen. By bringing ourselves
into accord with natural operations we share
in Nature’s power and efficiency. It is what the
ancients called the “Covert Agreement.” The fact
of your having penetrated the secret of the gods
enables you to claim their protection. The Masters
of Wisdom are in league with Nature for the protection
and benefit of mankind. This is what I have
elsewhere referred to as the Divine Conspiracy.</p>

  <h2 id='chap22' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-two'>XXII</abbr> <br> THE EQUALIZATION OF EPOCHS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>A considerable importance attaches to the
proper understanding of Epochs, so that when a
statement is made in terms of one Epoch we should
be able to refer it at once to another with which we
are familiar. There are several astronomical Epochs
of this nature which are frequently used and ought
to be known. Those who are interested in tracing
the astral cause of events often find themselves
debarred from research through ignorance regarding
the data employed. Much of this trouble can be
overcome by the determination and equalization of
Epochs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ptolemy, to whom we are indebted for a great
number of scientific statements in addition to his
astronomical observations and those of Hipparchus
which he has preserved to us, makes use of two
important Epochs. The first is that of Nabonasser.
The first year of his reign was in the year
747 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and the month Thoth began on the 26th
February in that year. Hence Nab. 1, Thoth 1
constitutes an Epoch equivalent to <abbr title='February'>Feb.</abbr> 26, 747
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> But this latter is the secular date and the
astronomical is one less, namely, 746 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> The
reason for this is that the secular date <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1 passes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>directly to the year 1 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, when counting backwards,
whereas the astronomical account makes
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1 refer back to <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 0, and then to 1 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> Hence
all dates <i>before</i> the Christian Era are given in secular
accounts as one year more than the astronomical.
Now as to the Egyptian months used by Ptolemy.

<p class='c006'>Each month contained thirty days, and there were
five days at the end of the year which they called
the Epagomene. The year began at noon on the
first of Thoth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another Epoch used by Ptolemy, and frequently
referred to by the Greeks, is that of Calippus. The
Calippic Period was invented by the man whose
name it bears and dates to the year 330 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> It is
a period of 76 years, which is four times 19, and was
designed to bring the new and full moons to the same
date of the solar year.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Olympiads were in use among the Greeks,
and began in the year 776 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, on the <abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> July (<abbr class='spell'>O.S.</abbr>).
Each Olympiad consists of four years, and in marking
a date the number of the Olympiad and the year of
that Olympiad are given. Thus the first of Calippus
would fall in the third year of the <abbr title='hundred and twelfth'>112th</abbr> Olympiad.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The astronomical years equivalent to these are, for
the Olympiads 775 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and for the Calippic Period
329 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>The Kali Yuga is an Indian Epoch which began
at the New Moon of February 3102 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>—<abbr title='February'>Feb.</abbr> <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr>.
The Epoch of Salivahana in use among the Dravidians
of India is the year <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 78.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinese Cycle of years began in the year
2696 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> (astronomical), at the New Moon of
February, the Sun being then half-way between the
Solstice and the Equinox.</p>

<p class='c006'>But even when we have the Epochs equalized
there are difficulties depending from this determination
of Epoch. This is particularly the case with
the Indian calendarics. They have in India a solar
year divided into solar months, and a lunar year
which is divided into lunar months. Thus the
first of Mesham is that point of time when the Sun
enters the first point of the constellation Mesham.
This is about the <abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> April. But the first of As’wini
is the day of New Moon in the constellation As’wini,
and this, of course, is a variable date, depending on
the position of the New Moon in relation to the first
point of Mesham.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever may be the date given in terms of
the Indian Calendar, before we can apply it we have
to know in what relations our zodiac stand to theirs.
They have a fixed point from which they make their
calculations. This is <i>Zeta Piscium</i>, which marks
the beginning of the constellations, and it corresponds
with the first of Mesham, or the Sun’s ingress
to the constellation Aries. We, on the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>count from the Vernal Equinox, the point at which
the Sun crosses the Equator in the spring. This
point, in relation to the fixed constellations, is
continually shifting westward at the rate of about
50´´ per year, and this is what is known as the precession
of the Equinoxes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The point we have to make is the relation of the
Equinox to the first point of Mesham. The difference
is what is called Ayanámsha. The difficulty
in the matter of calculation has been—(<abbr class='spell'><i>a</i></abbr>) the
exact rate of precession during past centuries, which
has only been determined in comparatively recent
years, and (<abbr class='spell'><i>b</i></abbr>) the unsatisfactory condition of Indian
astronomical data. But these latter, with the
advance of more exact methods in modern centres
of Indian learning, have been considerably improved,
and it is now justifiably possible to
attempt an equalization of the two astronomical
Epochs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very much depends on this, for it is quite
impossible to study the Indian astrological literature
without being able to refer their quantities
to terms of our modern Western ephemerides or
astronomical tables. When, for instance, the Indian
books say that a certain yoga or conjunctions of
planets in Kumbha means a particular thing, or
has a particular signification, they mean the constellation
Aquarius, and it will depend on the relations
of this constellation to our corresponding sign
Aquarius, as to what we are to understand. Also
in the determination of the various periods depending
on the Moon’s longitude at an Epoch, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>as that of birth, we have to convert the Moon’s
longitude into terms of our zodiac before we can
apply their interpretations, or synchronize the
periods with our own calendar. I have therefore
agitated for a long time past for a thorough examination
of the matter, and in despair of collaboration
in other directions I applied to Dr. <abbr class='spell'>V. V.</abbr> Ramanan
of Madras, one of the most distinguished pandits of
Southern India, and found in him a most useful
and able exponent of ancient Indian learning.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first attempt at a determination of the Epoch
or point of time when the Equinox coincided with
the first point of Mesham was from a comparison of
the length of the solar year as given in the <i>Suryasiddhanta</i>
and the value given in the best European
works. It is seen that the Indian year is longer
than the European estimate by 3 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 20·4 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>Now it is said that the Sun entered the sign
Mesham in the year 1900 at 30 ghatikas 50 vighatikas
after sunrise at Ujjain, on the <abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> April. This
equals <abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> April, at 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 31 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 28 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>p.m.</abbr>,
Greenwich mean time. The Sun’s longitude was
then 22° 11´ 4´´ from the Vernal Equinox, and this
divided by the mean rate of precession yields 1594
years, which taken from 1900 gives <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 306 as the
Epoch. Let us check this result.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen that the Indian year is estimated
at 3 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 20·4 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> more than the European. If
then we multiply this amount by 1594, the number
of years since the Epoch, we shall have 3 days
16 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 45 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 37·6 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> as the total increment. The
Sun in this time moves at a mean rate 3° 38´ 43´´,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and as this amount represents the excess of the
Indian solar year over the European during 1594
years, we should take it from 22° 11´ 4´´ in order to
obtain the true difference in longitude between the
Vernal Equinox and Mesham 0° in the year 1900.
This leaves 18° 33´ 21´´, which, being divided by the
mean rate of precession 50·1´´, gives 1335 years.
Allowing for the difference of the Sun’s anomaly
and the consequent increase of longitude, we should
make the longitude 19° 4´ 7´´ and the Epoch 1372
years, which would give the year <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 528, as compared
with <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 306 by the former calculation.</p>

<p class='c006'>This clearly shows that there is some miscalculation
in the Ujjain estimate of the Sun’s ingress,
and I am confirmed in this by a note from Dr.
Ramanan in which he says that “According to
Bhaskaracharya in his <i>Graha-ganitádhyáya</i>, the
Vernal Equinox of Kali Yuga 3628 (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 527),
coincided with the starting-point of the Hindu
ecliptic.” He adds that “the so-called fixed
Indian Zodiac is not thought to be really fixed, but
is subject to a slow motion of about 8´´ per year
eastwards. The zero point of Indian longitude is
thus subject to a slight annual displacement, and this
motion is a practical postulate of Hindu Siddhántas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But so far we have based all our calculations on

<p class='c014'>This represents the difference of sunrise due to
latitude. That is to say, a place in 11° North latitude,
and on the same meridian as Greenwich,
would have its sunrise 1 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 24 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> later than Greenwich
on the <abbr title='thirteenth'>13th</abbr> May, 1912. Now the sunrise on
this date at Greenwich was at 4 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 13 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr>,
and therefore at Kumbakonam the sunrise would
be at 5 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 37 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>The longitude of Kumbakonam is 5 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 18 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr>
east of Greenwich, and the equivalent Greenwich
time of sunrise at Kumbakonam will be <abbr class='spell'>G.M.T.</abbr>,
0 <abbr title='hour'>hr.</abbr> 19 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>a.m.</abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun’s longitude at this time according to the
Greenwich ephemeris is 1s. 21° 51´ 57´´, which we
may call Taurus 21° 52´. This, therefore, represents
the Indian estimate of the present value of
Ayanámsha.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mean rate of Equinoctial Precession for the
past eighteen centuries being 50·1´´ per year, we must
divide 21° 52´ by this amount of precession to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>obtain the year of coincidence. The result is 1571
years, which, being taken from the present year
1912, gives the year <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 341 as that in which the
two zodiacs coincided. But by taking the actual
precession for 1912 and the increment for <abbr class='spell'><abbr class='spell'><i>t</i></abbr> years
where <i>t</i></abbr> equals 1571 - 62, or 1509 years, we have
the actual precession as equal to 50´´ per year nearly,
and 21° 52´ divided by 50´´ is 1574, the years to be
taken from 1912, which gives the year <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 338.
According to our estimate of the rate of precession,
therefore, the Epoch will vary between <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 338
and 341. In round numbers, therefore, we may
regard the year <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 340 as that of the coincidence
of the zodiacs, and the number of years since elapsed
multiplied by the mean rate of 50·1´´ will give the
increment known as Ayanámsha for any date since
the Epoch.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I find an entry in the Ephemeris of Kumbakonam
to this effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mean amount of precession at commencement
of <abbr class='spell'>K.Y.</abbr> 5014 (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1912), 22° 27´ 20´´. Rate of
precession, 50·26´´.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if we divide the above amount of precession
by the rate we shall get 1612 years, which would
give the Epoch <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 300, whereas, as we have seen,
other data in the Ephemeris lead us to the year
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 340. Now I have checked the Kumbakonam
Ephemeris, and find that so far as the Solar ingresses
are concerned they agree with the Nautical
Almanac, and there would therefore appear to be
no reasonable doubt that if the true amount of
precession is here given, the true Epoch for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>coincidence of the zodiacs has been found. But I
am advised by Dr. <abbr class='spell'>V. V.</abbr> Ramanan that there is an
increment not generally recognized by either the
Indian or European astronomers, but which is
nevertheless an essential part of the calculation.
It is that of the progression of the asterisms or
constellations from west to east, along the order
of the signs at the rate of 8´´ per year, to which I
have already referred in an extract from one of his
valuable letters. If, therefore, we add this 8´´ to
the annual precession 50·1´´, we shall have 58·1´´
as the total precession of the Equinoxes on the first
point of As’wini, and then if we further divide the
amount of precession for the year 1912 as given in
the Panchángam, namely, 22° 27´ 20´´ by 58·1´´, we
shall get 1390 years, which taken from 1912 yields
the year of coincidence <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 521.</p>

<p class='c006'>From various sources, therefore, we have the years
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 300, 306, 338, 527, 528 and 521. The former
dates take account only of the precession of the
Equinoxes on a fixed zodiac, whereas the latter take
into account also a direct motion of this so-called
“fixed” zodiac which amounts to 8´´ per year, and
which has to be applied to the precession. It is
further to be observed that the Epochs 338 and 306,
variously derived above, are unified by the adoption
of 58·1´´ as the total annual precession of the Equinoxes
on the first point of As’wini. It needs but
quotation of authority for this increment of 8´´ in
order to establish the date of zodiacal coincidence
beyond disputation, at all events within the limits
of a very few years.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The above questions have an historical interest.
Varahamihira, who mentions the coincidence of the
solstices with the cardinal constellations Makaram
and Katakam as having taken place in his day, has
not been finally placed by the chronologists. Astronomical
notes made by him have chiefly been used
for this purpose, and the writing of his book the
<i>Brihat-samhita</i>, in which the above note occurs, is
on these grounds fixed at <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 505.</p>

<p class='c006'>But then we have to remember that Mihira speaks
only in general terms when he refers to the coincidence
of the zodiacs. He had no instruments
which would have enabled him to make a close
observation, but he could make certain approximations
from the meridian transit of some of the chief
stars in the constellations. We have no reason,
therefore, to expect more than an approximate
agreement of the date of Mihira with that of the
true coincidence of the zodiacs. The <i>Graha Laghava</i>,
which is in general use in India, gives this latter as
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 522 or 444 Shaka.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Shaka Epoch is known to be <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 78. Dr.
<abbr class='spell'>V. V.</abbr> Ramanan gives reasons for accepting the year
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 525. In the present state of the controversy
I see no reason against this Epoch.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h2 id='chap23' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-three'>XXIII</abbr> <br> LUNAR INFLUENCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The average notion of the Moon’s action is that
it affects the tides and lunatics. Beyond this the
popular encyclopedia does not go, and the average
man himself is not observant of anything in Nature
except the way of his fellow-man.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little study, however, will show that the Moon,
while influencing the tides, affects also all fluidic
life on the globe. It appreciably affects the sap-cells
of plants and trees. It exerts a direct influence
on blood pressure in the animal body, and consequently
affects the brain and nervous system of
human beings, and excites a variety of passions and
impulses which are but remotely connected with the
lunar orb itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may even be a fact that on account of the
observed influence of the Moon upon the physical
system of man, the ancients said that it ruled “the
populace,” and made of it a common significator of
public affairs. For it must be remembered that the
belief in lunar influence in mundane affairs, ordinarily
presumed to be of human origination and under
human control, was prevalent before the days of
printing and encyclopædic knowledge, possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>before the art of writing was invented, and men
then depended entirely on their powers of observation
for whatever knowledge they had. As many
of the ancient astronomical statements will show,
their powers of observation were almost the equal
of our scientific instruments. Thus Dr. Pouchet
rightly says: “Hipparchus and Ptolemy had no
instruments to scrutinize the heavens with. The
astronomers of the Renaissance, such as Regiomontanus,
Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler, were
scarcely more favoured, and yet how many immortal
discoveries do we owe to them! They seem with
their lynx eyes to have seen or divined everything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They observed not only the courses of the stars and
planets as well as those of the luminaries, but what
is of more human interest, they watched the effects
that these bodies had upon the course of human
events and upon nations and persons. That the
Moon influenced the weather was the logical deduction
from the fact of its influence upon the waters
of the earth. For obviously the Moon must not
only be water-lifter, but also a cloud-lifter, and its
effects upon the atmosphere itself must be in proportion
to the saturation point of the air from hour
to hour according to the incidence of its rays. Only
when all meteorological methods have failed to
indicate the kind of weather we are likely to have,
to predict the kind of summer we shall have, or
even to explain such as we have, then men throw
about for new ideas, and frequently manage to seize
upon old ones. This of the Moon’s influence on the
weather is one such.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>I have this following note of intelligence from the
<i>Daily Mail</i> of the <abbr title='fourteenth'>14th</abbr> August last: “The tides
follow the Moon; local weather conditions are indisputably
affected by the tides. Scientific meteorologists
no doubt laugh the belief to scorn, but
observers who are not scientific can produce sufficient
data to prove that a change of weather coinciding
with a change of the Moon is usually lasting.” The
<i>Daily Mail</i> is right. But unfortunately the theory
of the Moon’s influence on the weather has been
badly distorted since the learned and observant
Dr. Clark took the matter in hand and formulated
a theory based on observations conducted over a
very long period.</p>

<p class='c006'>His theory goes to show that the Moon does not act
directly upon the weather, but by a tidal action upon
the Earth’s atmospheric envelope, which accordingly
depends upon the time of the Moon’s syzygies
and quadratures. It is this time-factor that has
been overlooked and neglected. Reduced to a single
sentence, the lunar theory may be stated as follows:—The
nearer to midnight any phase of the Moon
may occur, the finer will be the weather during the
ensuing week, and consequently the nearer to midday
it may occur, the more humid will be the weather.
The barometer which shows the atmospheric pressure
at a mean altitude will consequently be affected in
terms of the above statements, and as it ranges from
28° to 30° over these islands, we may also indicate
the state of the barometer from the Moon’s phases.
For it will be seen that, so long as there is but moderate
wind, the barometer will answer to the Moon’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>phases in harmony with the weather. Very strong
winds without rainfall will affect the barometer
and register a fall. I have endeavoured to embody
the whole of this theory of the Moon’s action on the
weather in a single diagram.</p>

<p class='c006'>In attempting to account for a very wet summer
in the year 1912, and a record downfall of rain in
the month of August, I shall have to refer to the
times of the phases of the Moon since the solstice.
Here are the dates and times, taken from the
Ephemeris of Greenwich.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here there are indications of plenty of variable
and changeable weather, with splashes of very wet
and stormy weather, and just a suspicion of fair
in the whole period.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this class of observation does not help us
much, for there are other factors in the cosmos beside
the Moon, which, although nearest the earth and
exerting much influence of its own kind upon mundane
things, is not a very considerable factor when
regarded in its cosmic relations to other great bodies
in the system. The idea that the Moon is the only
body capable of affecting the weather is hardly
to be sustained by reference to the facts. It is
thoroughly well established that the phases of any
of the planets, that is to say, their conjunctions,
oppositions and quadratures with the Sun, as seen
from the Earth, are accompanied by marked effects
upon the weather. Dr. Clark’s theory seems to
suggest that fine weather follows the Moon, or at all
events that the weather will be finest in those places
whereat the Moon is nearest the meridian at the time
of one of its phases. There is a great deal to be
said for this theory if we distinguish between the
syzygies and quadratures.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>But if the Moon has any action on the Earth’s
atmosphere, the planets also must exert an appreciable
effect, and it may lead to some well-established
theory if we include the positions of certain of the
planets at the quadratures and syzygies. In such
case it is reasonable to presume that those planets
which are near the meridian and horizon at the times
of the equinoxes and solstices are likely to give us
some indication of the probable weather during
the following season, and similarly, such as are near
these angles at the syzygy may show the modifications
likely to occur during the ensuing month. A
series of observations such as these would probably
lead to the association of certain features of the
weather with the various planets. Astrologers have
already completed their observations, but that should
not prevent an independent series of observations
being made by those who wish to come to independent
conclusions in the matter, and the subject is one
that deserves attention at the hands of scientific
men.</p>

<p class='c006'>But lunar action does not begin and end with its
effects on the weather. There are other and even
more important effects to be noted, and although
they are more recondite in their nature, and not
so well grounded in reasons which would appeal
to any but Occultists, they nevertheless deserve
attention. One of these is the effect of the Moon
in human affairs. We can all appreciate the effects
that the Moon has on the waters, for we can see the
rise and fall of the tides, but that more subtle influence
that the luminary has upon the finer states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of matter in and about the earth is not so readily
appreciated. But it will be found none the less a
fact if put to the test.</p>

<p class='c006'>What we may call the tidal point is that point
midway between the Sun and Moon at any time.
Suppose it to be a new moon to-day, at the hour of
noon. The Sun and Moon will then come to the
meridian at the same time that they are conjoined in
the same longitude. To-morrow they will be about
12° apart when they come to the meridian, and the
next day they will be 24° apart. Now as one degree
passes the meridian every four minutes, the daily
difference of Tide-time will be (12 × 4)/2, or 24 minutes.
Local conditions affect the time at which high tide
occurs, and also the effect of the joint action of the Sun
and Moon will take time to produce. Consequently
we do not see that the tides exactly synchronize
with the transit of the Tide-point.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is a great difference between ether and
water, and between mind and matter. What we
know as the Astral Tide occurs exactly at the time
of the transit of the Tide-point, and this fact is
of the highest importance to those who would avail
themselves of celestial influences and take that
tide at the flood which “leads to fortune.” There
is an old adage which says: Who takes the Tide
takes all. If, therefore, we take the difference in
longitude between the Sun and Moon at any time,
which distance is called the Moon’s elongation,
and divide this by two, we shall obtain a point which
passes the meridian at a time represented by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>quantity multiplied by four minutes, before or after
the Sun’s transit of the meridian, according as the
Moon is increasing or decreasing in light. Thus,
I would find the time of the Astral Tide on the <abbr title='twenty-first'>21st</abbr>
August, 1912.</p>

<p class='c014'>This for 3 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 41 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 2 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr> amounts to about
1° 42´, which multiplied by four gives 6 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 48 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>,
and this added to the above first time of Tide,
brings us to 3 <abbr title='hours'>hrs.</abbr> 47 <abbr title='minute'>min.</abbr> 50 <abbr title='seconds'>sec.</abbr>, which is the time
after the meridian transit of the Sun at which the
Astral Tide will occur.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reference to the almanac will show that on the
<abbr title='twenty-first'>21st</abbr> August the Sun passes the meridian at about
four minutes after noon, and therefore the Greenwich
mean time of the Astral Tide will be 3.52 <abbr class='spell'>p.m.</abbr></p>

<p class='c006'>Now if you would float an idea, of whatever nature,
let it go out upon the full tide, not when the tide is
flowing in, and not when it is going out, but at the
point of time when the tide is at the full and about
to turn. But reflect that what you send out will
come back to you laden with its burden of consequence.
It is important, therefore, that the nature
of your flotation should be scrutinized.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Astrologers the world over have always considered
that the Moon exerts a great influence over human
generation. We know that it plays a most important
part in the normal functions of the human body,
more especially as affecting the blood pressure. This
may be the reason for its marked influence upon
persons in certain forms of insanity. In my <i>Manual
of Astrology</i> I have shown beyond all doubt that it
exerts a powerful influence in the matter of sex,
and also that there is an astronomical relation
between the Moon’s motion and the process of
generation culminating in birth. The ancients
have said that the various months of parturition
are under the successive influence of the planets,
Saturn, Jupiter, etc., thus—</p>

<p class='c014'>Swedenborg has said that all children come from
the Moon. There is a Greek legend which associates
Selene and Selinon, confounding the Moon with the
parsley plant, and old women to-day tell their
inquisitive grandchildren that they were brought
from the parsley bed. In the Greek Mysteries the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>soul passes through the sphere of the Moon in its
descent to the Earth, taking upon itself a silver
vestment, which is the astral or lunar body, as distinguished
from the imperishable solar body proper
to the incarnating ego.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Hindus, as has been shown elsewhere, make
all their astrological calculations from the place of
the Moon, and the horoscope of birth is converted
into terms of the Moon’s position at the moment
of that event. Also they reckon the periodic effects
from the same position. It is therefore obvious
that the astrologer at all events has not overlooked
the enormous influence that this orb is believed to
exert upon mundane affairs and human life. As
we have seen, the ancients, with whom these beliefs
arose, were keen observers of natural operations,
and depended entirely on their unaided and unprejudiced
observations for whatever knowledge
they possessed. They regarded the Moon as the
purveyor or carrier of astral influence. Life and
energy were generated from the Sun, the vital centre
of our system. This life was modified by reflection
of rays from the various planets, which transmitted
the Sun’s rays to this Earth in altered electrical
and magnetic conditions, and the Moon, circling
round the Earth at great velocity, collected and
distributed these influences upon our nether sphere.
The notion is at least cosmical and coherent. If
it also be true it is of the utmost importance to us
as terrestrials.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Moon, then, in Cosmic Symbolism represents
the element of functional variability, and is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>symbol of Change, of ebb and flow, of increase and
decrease, of rise and fall. It is associated with the
human soul subject to <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><i>samsara</i></span>, or the law of cyclic
rebirth. It is the Mercabah or vehicle by which
the light and heat of the Sun is distributed, the
Great Conveyancer and the Universal Purveyor of
celestial influences. Like the human soul it is
subject to phases, now waxing and now waning,
and sometimes suffering eclipse, having no light
of its own but deriving all from the Universal
Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has two aspects, a nether and a higher. That
which is above represents the side that, at the time
of conjunction, is turned towards the Sun, and the
lower is that which is always towards the Earth.
When the Moon-Soul is between the Sun and Earth
it is in correct cosmic relations, but when the Earth
interposes its dark orb, there is an ascendancy of
the material over the human, and the spiritual light
is in danger of being shut out. The Moon-body
suffers death, like the physical body, but it persists
after the death of the physical, and may endure for
upwards of one hundred and twenty years, according
to its inherent vitality.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be regarded as the Purgatorial vestment
in which the Human Soul manifests until its liberation
to the Spiritual world. One of the initiations
teaches that this same Moon-Body may, without
suffering dissolution, be again carried to earth and
incarnated. But this is not the normal case, as
those who have witnessed the dissolution of the
Moon-Body well know. As a cosmic symbol the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Moon is replete with the deepest mysteries concerning
the birth, evolution, and dissolution of all that
is commonly called human. Its influence in mundane
affairs gains an additional signification from
this fact.</p>

  <h2 id='chap24' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-four'>XXIV</abbr> <br> SOLAR INFLUENCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The Sun as the centre of the universe is the
gravitational focus of all the forces of the cosmos.
It stands to us as the symbol of Deity, or of that
Logos which is the manifestation to us of the
Inscrutable and Omnipresent. So far as we are
concerned it is the source of Light and Heat to the
world, and these two properties are the ultimate
expressions of the Wisdom and Love of the Creator.
When we speak of light and heat we mean those
forces which, when they impinge on the Earth’s
atmosphere and are sensed by us, produce the sensations
of light and heat. The Sun is thus rather the
source of the cause of heat and light than of heat and
light themselves. It is we who are the interpreters.
Even so is it with regard to the Divine principles of
Wisdom and Love. These in expression are manifest
as Truth and Charity, as Knowledge and
Affection, as Thought and Feeling, as Speech and
Action. This gives us the following gradient of
differentiation—</p>

<table class='table4'>

  <tr>
    <td class='c008'>Wisdom</td>
    <td class='c008'>Divine</td>

    <td class='c008'>Speech</td>

    <td class='c009'>Action</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Thus we see how through the various planes of
life the Divine principles filtrate, as do the forces
we know as Light and Heat through the various
ethers, until they manifest in our physical life. For
the Spirit of Truth is the manifestation of the
Hidden Wisdom of the Father, and its Bride is the
Spirit of Charity. Manifesting in the human they
are seen as Knowledge and Affection on the Intellectual
plane, and on the Psychic or emotional plane as
Thought and Feeling, these being derived from the
former, and ultimately finding expression as Speech
and Action. Thus all the life of man is linked up
with the Divine, as all the universe is with its cosmic
centre the Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun shines upon all and illumines all when
there are no clouds of doubt interposing themselves
between us and the open canopy of heaven. These
clouds arise by evaporation from the ferment of
the lower nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the cosmic centre, the Sun represents the Heart
or seat of vitality in the Microcosm. Astrologically
it has its seat in the sign Leo which corresponds with
the Cardiac zone, including the heart and solar
plexus. It is thus related to the vital principle in
man. Its position and aspects in a horoscope will
determine the stability of the Constitution and hence
the natural duration of life. Its sign, position and
aspects in the world are the chief cause of the
variations of season and the nature of the weather.
These season changes are, of course, related to the
climate in different zones. The effects that are due
in the British Isles to solar aspects with the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>planets have already been scheduled. Saturn and
Uranus are found to be magnetic and cold producing,
while Jupiter and Mars are electric and heat producing.
Venus acts to produce condensation resulting
in drizzle or fine rain. Mercury brings fresh
winds; Neptune fine weather. Saturn in the same
way brings northerly and easterly winds, Venus
westerly winds, Jupiter south-westerly and Mars
south-easterly winds. Uranus brings winds from
the north-west, and generally frequent showers
with intermittent spells of sunshine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus we may set the compass as follows—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig27.jpg' alt='Figure 27.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 27.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These observations apply only to the British Isles,
and more particularly to England, where the
observations were made. Everybody will recollect
that the Coronation Day of King George <abbr title='the fifth'>V</abbr> was a
wet day. At that time the Sun was in semisquare
aspect to both Venus and Saturn. Those resident in
England will also recall the exceptionally hot days
during the end of July and the beginning of August.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The Sun was then passing from the quartile of
Jupiter to the quartile of Mars, both heat-producing
planets. The positions are necessarily geocentric,
as we are considering the effects of the planetary
modifications of solar energy so far as this Earth is
concerned.</p>

<p class='c006'>In just similar manner as the solar conditions act
upon the Earth so they act upon the physical
constitution of man. For if at his birth the Sun is
affected by the rays of negative planets there will
be less vitality and force, while positive heat-producing
planets, such as Jupiter and Mars, will
give great vitality, strong muscular development,
a great fund of energy and a sound constitution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun represents the organic constitution in
the same way that the Moon represents the functional
powers. Hence it is that the Sun, when
afflicted by malefic aspects of the planets at a birth,
gives warning of organic disorders of an inherent or
hereditary nature, while the Moon similarly afflicted
denotes functional disorders of an acquired nature.
For many reasons we may regard man as in the
same relations with his cosmic environment as is
the Earth itself. Compounded as he is of cosmic
elements, he responds at all points to changes that
are continually taking place in the system. But he
does so in terms of his radical constitution or root
nature, which, of course, varies as the individual
concerned. For all sidereal and planetary forces,
while possessing their respective properties and
expressing their own several natures, are differently
received and transmuted according to the constitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of the recipient body. Hence the planets only
affect us in terms of ourselves. The same white
solar ray falling upon an emerald and a ruby will
be differently reflected by each of them, appearing as
green in the one case and red in the other. So it is
with men. They each reflect the Wisdom and Love
of the Universal Being in a variety of forms of knowledge
and affection, expressed in speech and action,
which is the common life. This fact should save
us all from the error of bigotry and dogmatism. It
is only the Diamond Heart that can reflect the pure
ray of the Divine. It is comforting to know that
the diamond is the mature carbo-hydrate. Given
the conditions and the time, the soul that is as black
as coal can become, by evolutional processes, as
clear and pellucid as the diamond. We begin as
fragments of gross earth and end as suns in the
galaxy of heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is customary for astrologers to refer to the
various planets as good, evil and neutral. Thus
Saturn, Uranus and Mars are regarded as malefic,
while Jupiter and Venus are called Benefics. This
is not the truth, however convenient it may be to
retain these ascriptions for purposes of delineation.
Every planet has two aspects, and these aspects are
referred to the higher and lower natures of our being.
Mars, for instance, is merely Energy, the focussed
or specialized vitality of the Sun. It answers to
the red ray. Operating in a person of low mental
and moral calibre, it will produce a Free-thinker, a
Firebrand and Anarchist, and a man of violence
and lawlessness. The same planet, when expressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>itself through a highly evolved nature, will manifest
as zeal, fervour, intensity, enthusiasm, enterprise,
ambition and moral courage. Venus in the same
way may indicate self-indulgence, idleness, pleasure-seeking,
vanity, frailty and licence in a person of
low nature, while in one of greater moral fibre and
higher standard of life, the same planet will manifest
as gentleness, kindness, charity, pure affection,
orderliness and refinement. There is a whole cycle
of evolution between the sordid, money-grubbing
propensities of “the man with the muck-rake” and
the provident carefulness and circumspection of
the man who is under the influence of the higher
Saturnine ray. It is all a question of personal
colouring. It is not that the planets rule us and
compel us to be that which we are, but that we transmute
and corrupt the natures of the planets and
abuse the energies and powers which they confer
on us. We can never hope to be lords of the
Universe, but we can be rulers of ourselves. Self-government
is at the root of the matter. We attain
to it through experience and suffering. It is not
born with any man, but there are those among us
who remember their lessons well and speedily get
themselves into touch with their environment, and
their faculties and powers under control. It is not
altogether a truth that “The wise man rules his
stars and the fool obeys them.” It is rather the
fact that the wise man rules <i>himself</i>, all else the
stars compel. True, a number of oppositions and
squares in a horoscope of birth will certainly give
a man a full share of experience, but the uses of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>adversity are sweet. Evolution does not wholly consist
in getting all we can out of life, but also of reading
into it as much as we can. We all know how much
we are affected by our environment. Our business
is to find out how much our environment can be
affected by us. And by environment we have to
include that which presses us most nearly in the form
of our own personality. To get this under our control
is very largely to annihilate the adverse aspects
of the planets.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this is possible, because all planetary influences
are modes of the One life, and that which animates
the physical body is the solar ray, while that which
animates the mind of man is the Spiritual Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Life has no qualities of its own, it gets them by
use or function. The same energy that is expended
in rioting and bloodshed could as readily be used for
purposes of constructive enterprise. Extravagance
is only a morbid generosity, a philanthropy gone
astray. The Sun that shines alike on the just and
the unjust cannot be credited with all the abuses
to which we submit our vital powers. Why, then,
should we ascribe to the planets all those evil
influences which in truth have no existence except
in ourselves, who are both receivers and transmitters
of their influence? This truth has been finally
stated by the great Interpreter, who said: The
good man out of the good treasure of his heart
bringeth forth that which is good, and the evil man
out of his evil treasure brings forth that which is
evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far as their cosmic functions are concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the planets are organic interpreters, the Sun being
the source of Vitality or Life. The Sun, therefore,
holds chief place in the consideration of astrologers
and is the foundation principle of the horoscope,
all calculations and all measures of time having
regard to the Sun’s position and to its postnatal
motion.</p>

<p class='c006'>No wonder that the ancients gave to the Sun a
place in Cosmic Symbolism which embraced a whole
mythology and gave rise to the use of its symbol
in all religious services, seeing that it is the source
of all physical life and illumination. The ancient
Aryans and the Persians regarded it as the physical
presentation of the Supreme Being, and even at
this day it is retained as a divine symbol in the
ordinances of the Catholic Church. Some idea of
the divine attributes ascribed to the Day-star may
be gathered from the Vedic Hymns, one of which I
have endeavoured to represent in the following
lines—</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sun and Moon are universally regarded as
the symbols of the Male-female unity of Nature.
The Sun is the father, the Moon the mother, of all
mundane events. Astrologers refer these orbs to
the organs of sight, giving the Sun dominion over
the right eye and the Moon over the left. When
the Sun and Moon are afflicted, especially in certain
parts of the zodiac, they indicate blindness or defective
vision. It has been stated by Dr. Fearon that
there is an affinity between the right eye and the
male line of heredity, and between the left eye and
the female line, and that defects inherited from one
line or the other are incidental to the corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>organ. That there is a great connection with the
state of the eye and the general health is a proved
fact of which medical men frequently avail themselves
in their diagnosis. We have already considered
the Sun and Moon as the luminaries of the day and
night, and we find this idea associated with the visual
power in the <i>Sayings of Jesus</i>: “If thine eye be
good thy whole body shall be full of light, but if thine
eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness.”
In effect we find that when the iris of the eye is firm
and clear and of a single unbroken colour, the
health is good. But when it is split up and discoloured
by green streaks the health is imperfect,
while red spots in the iris, giving a patchy appearance,
are a sure sign of some organic disease, and
most likely of a growth. It is only when we come to
admit the psychic origin of disease that we can fully
apprehend the value of the Scripture statement. It
is an inductive argument which regards the eye as
the index of the general health of the body, itself
standing as a symbol of intelligence. Conformity
with the spiritual law of being would undoubtedly
result in perfect integrity of soul and body. The
natural has no life apart from the spiritual. The
basis of all things is Spirit, and matter as we know it
is its ultimate expression. The Sun, which is the
most active form of matter, is thus the concrete
symbol of Spirit. Among all symbolical forms of
worship, that of the Sun-worshippers is the most
rational. Human science may avail much to institute
artificial conditions of life, but it will never succeed
in dethroning the Sun.</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'>It could hardly be expected that one in my
position, having the reputation of being one of
those modern fools who go searching after ancient
wisdom, could write a book on Cosmic Symbolism
and successfully avoid the subject of Astrology. I
admit to have trespassed on its preserves more or
less in every chapter of this book. Now I may as
well take a gun and make a day of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is safe to say that no considerable argument
has ever been successfully raised against the claims
of Astrology to a place among the sciences. No
valid reason can be given for disputing its principles,
and its facts have never been overset. It is true
that Pico della Mirandola, called Flagellum Astrologiæ
because of his avowed hatred of the subject,
attempted to expel it from among the Latins and
was an ardent pamphleteer in the cause of its
suppression. But he justified its claims and practically
unsaid all that he had written by dying at the
time predicted by the astrologers. Dr. John Butler,
Chaplain to James Duke of Ormonde, had a mind
to inveigh against its teachings, which by some
misconception he fancied to be pagan and subversive
of Christianity. He studied the subject the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>effectively to assail the assertions of the astrologers,
and ended his campaign by writing a book in support
of its teachings. It is a book rather well known to
students of the subject and can be seen at the
British Museum.</p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps the most sounding rebuke that was
ever given to such as foolishly repudiate the whole
thing without taking the trouble to examine its
principles and methods, was given by Sir Isaac
Newton to Mr. Halley of comet fame when he
ventured to dispute the subject with the great
philosopher. The latter heard him to a finish and
then quietly remarked: “I have studied the subject,
Mr. Halley, you have not.” I do not know what was
Halley’s perspective and therefore I cannot say in
what regard he held the author of the <i>Principia</i>, but
personally I would rather be swallowed by an earthquake
than have such a rebuke from the same
source. There was always that about Newton which
inspired confidence in his utterances, for a more
fearless and at the same time humble-minded investigator
of Nature never breathed God’s air. He
spoke of what he knew.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the presentation of astrological evidence we
are not called upon to display the <i>modus operandi</i>
of planetary action in human life. We can observe
facts without references to their causes. We may
legitimately theorize as to the means whereby a
universe is brought into existence, but none can
say why. One is relieved of the necessity from the
fact that he is not the Creator of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are many suggestions afforded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>modern scientific discoveries which lead us to the
idea that planetary influence, apart from the attraction
of gravitation, may be due to the functions of
subtle states of matter such as we posit as properties
of spatial ether. And since we know nothing of
force apart from matter it is reasonable to presume
that whatever forces are at play in the cosmos have
their appropriate material vehicles. Spectrum analysis
does not lead us to suppose that there is any
material difference in the chemical constituents of
the various bodies of the system, and what you find
in the planets you find also in the Sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>Certain considerations regarding the nature of
matter lead us, however, to the conclusion that,
apart from its properties, it has characteristics which
depend not so much upon its atomic constituents
as upon their arrangement. From this we may
argue that inasmuch as we are all compounded of
the same cosmic elements, differences of character
and temperament are due to the ascendancy of one
over other of those elements in individuals. This,
so far as the personality is concerned, may well be
true, but because material atoms have no emotions,
aspirations, hopes and fears, and no moral sense,
they cannot be said to acquire such by mere conglomeration.
To carry the argument further, therefore,
we should have to derive our atoms from
something rather more spiritual than the hydrogen
base, the “happy hunting-ground” of the physicists.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far as the planets’ action on our organisms is
concerned, it may be that the brain cells, infilled
as they are with a nervous pabulum, are capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>responding to the more subtle vibrations of the
ether. But the immaterial parts of us must respond
to immaterial stimuli, and we know that there are
other than merely physical effects due to planetary
influence. And whereas matter is continuous of
matter throughout the entire universe, mind is
continuous of mind, and spirit of spirit. Thus it is
that “Soul to soul strikes through a finer element
of its own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>We must therefore recognize that there may be a
supra-cosmical as well as an intra-cosmical planetary
action, and this follows from the argument that,
matter being the ultimate expression of Spirit, the
material planets have their spiritual counterparts.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, to come to the practical side of the
argument for and against the subject, I may deal
with some of the more weighty objections which
have been lodged against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>First, there is the argument of coincidence which
is used to explain away the fact of successful prediction.
This in cool logic is no argument at all,
for the only coincidence that is shown is that of
the prediction and the subsequent course of events.
Now if there were a single prediction which in
human judgment could not have been otherwise
foretold but by the application of some commonly-called
“occult” knowledge, this would suffice to
confirm the claim that foreknowledge is scientifically
possible. But what do we mean by coincidence.
If apples falling from a tree pursued different directions,
some falling direct to the earth and some in
the contrary direction towards the sky, while others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>went off at a tangent, it may be called a coincidence
that one should fall in the direction previously
determined upon and named. But if all the apples
tend in the same direction and fall along the lines
of the earth’s radial magnetism direct towards its
centre, then we may posit a law of attraction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if we can show a definite direction of all
planetary influence—that is to say, show that the
same planet always maintains the same significance
in the astrological scheme, that its effects are always
of the same general character, and that these effects
synchronize with the arc by which the planet is
separated from the position of any of the prescribed
Significators, then we may claim to have established
the law of planetary influence—or, if you will, of
cosmic symbolism. We are not now concerned with
the question of the causative or symbolic relations
of our greater environment. This connection
between planet and event we can certainly show.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another argument is that the discovery of the
heliocentric system by Copernicus invalidated the
conclusions of the astrologers which were based on
the geocentric positions of the planets. We cannot
allow this for the following reasons. The Suryasiddhanta
of India antedates the system of Copernicus
by many hundreds of years and it is heliocentric.
India is nevertheless the schoolhouse if not
the nursery of Astrology, and planetary influence in
human life is practically an article of faith with the
Hindus. The conclusions of Copernicus were confirmed
and demonstrated by Tycho and Kepler.
Tycho practised astrology while Kepler confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>its principles and added to its credentials by successful
prediction. In a universe of relativity, every
planet is the centre of its own system, as every man
is the centre of his own world, and the Astrologer
who studies the action of the planets on this earth
and its inhabitants, rightly regards the latter as the
passive centre of such action. As the fortunes of a
country centre in its Ruler, so those of the individual
centre in himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>A further argument urged against the Science is
that the discovery of the planets Neptune and
Uranus must vitiate conclusions drawn from an
incomplete cosmical system. The argument has
really very little value. The discovery of Argon
as a constituent of the earth’s atmosphere does not
involve any change in our ideas about oxygen,
hydrogen, or nitrogen. What was argued in regard
to the nature of Saturn a thousand years ago is
maintained by all modern Astrologers. It is the
same with all the other planets. Only we have the
added knowledge of the nature and influence of the
two planets Neptune and Uranus to supplement
what the ancients knew about the rest of the solar
system. In former days when they could not
discover adequate reasons for death, a man was
said to have died by “the visitation of God.”
To-day with our extended knowledge of the solar
system it is found that Uranus or Neptune has been
the agent of the Lord of Life and Death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another objection raised against the idea of
planetary influence is that the bodies are so remote
and insignificant as to be incapable of producing any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>marked effects in mundane affairs. The objection
is grounded in ignorance. The distance of the
planets bears no relation to their influence or power
to affect us. This will be obvious to those who have
reflected on the fact that etheric vibration becomes
“light” only when it impinges on the earth’s
atmosphere, and the fact also that the attraction
of gravitation operates irrespective of distance and
maintains the solidarity of the system. Planetary
perturbations due to the mutual attraction of the
several bodies is an adequate reply to the objection
of Cicero. Sir David Brewster argues that if light
could reach us from the distant stars and planets,
other influences may also reach us from the same
sources. Cicero, on the other hand, while possessed
of magnificent ideas of the solar system and fully
admitting its solidarity, asks with evident lack of
argument, “What contagion can reach us from the
planets whose distances are almost infinite?” We
have gone beyond the “infinite” of Cicero since
that question was asked, and modern astronomers
are able to demonstrate the fact that the Sun, while
acting as the centre of attraction in its own system,
is answering to the gravitational pull of some star in
the confines of space, and that it has a proper motion
of its own in a vast orbit about that centre. I have
already expressed the view that Plato knew of this
and that it was the basis of his Great Year. What
hinders that our Sun may receive influences from
its own lode-star, and that these may be transmitted
to us in common with the other planets of our
system? There is no harm in using the scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>imagination providing that we have some fact from
which to proceed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In connection with the teachings of astrology there
is the scientific fact of natural selection to be
considered. What is it that determines birth under
particular astral conditions. We say that it is
innate tendency. Locke, who in his <i>Human Understanding</i>
argued for “no innate ideas” had a faulty
perspective. He failed to account for genius through
sense-impressions, as others have later failed to
account for it through cumulative heredity. We
have instances before us where it is obvious that
there was nothing to accumulate so far as special
forms of genius were concerned.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, on the other hand, we accept the human being
as an evolving Monad passing through a succession
of incarnations for the purposes of experience and
ultimate specialization of faculty, we shall at once
understand how it is that certain persons are
endowed with precocious tendencies of a definite
order from infancy, and indeed birth. Given the
time necessary to get into touch with the physical
instrument and to “tune up,” as it were, the appearance
of unusual faculty can in no way be hindered,
because it is innate. In this connection Astrology
affirms that persons are born with particular horoscopes
because when the heavens are so disposed as
to admit of, and indeed to favour, the expression of
certain forms of genius and faculty, the Soul requiring
those conditions is borne into earth-life. The doctrine
involves the suggestion that there is a purpose in
human existence and that such purpose is neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>begun nor fulfilled in any one incarnation. Then,
as there is a Spiritual Law in the Natural World,
and a supra-cosmic law of planetary action, we can
see how the line of least resistance is determined by
innate tendency. In the Wisdom of Solomon it is
said: “I am not good because I was born into an
undefiled body, but being good I was born into a
body undefiled.” There is therefore an ancient belief
in the determination of birth conditions to innate
character.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colourless and purposeless individuals are found
to be responsive to general or group influences and
to be moved by the feelings and thoughts that
animate the crowd. They have not yet attained
that power of self-direction which characterizes the
highly evolved Monad. Accentuated and purposeful
characters, on the other hand, require specific
influences under which to be born, and these
influences must be conformable to the purpose in
view. What that purpose is may be seen from
their life and actions, and indeed it is written all
over them for those who understand the physiognomy
of Nature. Occasionally we have the incarnation
of special Messengers who are responsive to the
collective spirit of the superior world. These are
found to voice the needs of the soul rather than of
the body of man and their minds answer to a higher
law than that which controls the average individual.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very many factors conspire to the production of
those astral conditions which favour the expression
of individual character of a high order. Much
depends on the sphere of life in which the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of evolution requires that they shall function. We
have such examples of marked men in all spheres
of life. But wherever they appear they are easily
discernible by their horoscopes. Nature is not so
profligate as some people imagine, for in the long
run it is seen that her ways and means are those
which invariably secure the end in view. If she is
apparently careless of the mass she is at all events
jealously careful in regard to such as have specialized,
and we find by practical experience that she adapts
environment to purpose with infinite care and
foresight.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we take the astral conditions obtaining over any
particular period of a year and consider them in
relation to the number of births occurring in any
particular area, we shall find that so far as the
cosmic relations of the planets are concerned they
will remain practically undisturbed for a considerable
time. Thus Neptune will be in the same sign for
about 14 years, Uranus for 7 years, Saturn for 2½
years, Jupiter for one year, and Mars for nearly
two months, Venus and Mercury changing signs
within the month. So that, from a cosmical point
of view, quite a large number of births will take
place under similar conditions, for even the Moon,
which represents the element of variability, will
continue in the same sign for about 2½ days, and in
a thickly populated area such as the City of London,
where the average birth-rate is 14 per hour, we may
have as many as 840 births under exactly the same
zodiacal conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it happens that the ancient astrologers thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>out this problem somewhat fully, and consequently
they directed their attention to the conditions
obtaining in regard to a given locality. In other
words, they paid more attention to the rising,
culmination and setting of the planets than to their
zodiacal positions. Now a simple calculation will
show that as 1° of the zodiac passes the meridian
every four minutes, and 15° every hour, there is
enough and to spare for the fourteen births which take
place on an average in the most densely populated
centre of the world, so that each of them may be
born under a separate degree. But the fact probably
is, and necessarily I am theorizing on the
point, that people are born in batches, for where
special conditions are not required the common
experiences of life will serve for all the evolutional
needs of a large majority of those born into the
world. Moreover, as I have already said, the
planets affect us in terms of ourselves, so that the
same planetary conditions will be variously interpreted
by individuals born at the same time, according
to their degree of evolution. Consequently
I do not see any astrological objection to any
number of persons being born under the same
stellar conditions, and it is indeed probable that
the horoscopes of all our kings and leaders will find
duplicates all over the country. All that we note
in such circumstances is that the events of their
lives have a certain set parallelism from birth until
death, while so long as these individual souls are
under the sway of those stellar conditions, they
interpret them according to their own natures and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>in terms of their sphere of life. A notable case, but
by no means the only one that could be cited is that
of John Hemmings and King George <abbr title='the third'>III</abbr>. Both
were born on the same day and at the same hour in
the same parish of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Martins-le-Fields, in London.
When George <abbr title='the second'>II</abbr> died John Hemmings’ father died.
George <abbr title='the third'>III</abbr> succeeded to the throne and John
Hemmings to his father’s business, which was that
of an ironmonger. They were married on the same
day, had the same number of children of the same
sexes, and died on the same day and at nearly the
same hour. The Webbs, the Cloughs and the
Morells are famous cases of twins whose lives were
at all points similar, and this, not because they were
born of the same parents but because they were born
under exactly the same astral conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mundane factor as distinguished from the
zodiacal, that is to say, the positions of the planets
in the prime vertical as distinguished from their
positions in the zodiac, is that which makes for
individual expression. Three hundred and sixty
persons could be born in a single day in any one
locality and each of these could have a horoscope
that is distinct and individual. The highest record
does not reach this number.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this factor of variation in the expression of
human character and destiny, it is possible to
understand how the Arch-arbiter of our destinies
may, for the ultimate purposes of our spiritual
evolution, determine the application of the individual
psychoplasm to the physical centres of life at times
when the cosmical and mundane conditions are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>harmonious to the end designed. From an astrological
point of view there is room and to spare for the
expression of every phase of human character and
development, and that is the same as saying that
the One Life is capable of an infinite variety of
manifestations in the process of time. This doubtless
was the thought animating Shelley’s oft-quoted
phrase—</p>

</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sir Francis Galton</span> in his <i>Enquiry into Human
Faculty</i> has laid it down as an axiom for the study
of Eugenists that “Nature is stronger than Nurture.”
His researches and tabulated statistics undoubtedly
point this conclusion. We have therefore to regard
life in terms of this fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the making of destiny Character is the prime
factor, and the modifying factor is Environment.
Reform that has an eye only to externals will never
be finally effective. Only that which makes for
the upbuilding of individual character will secure
permanent results. Without doubt character demands
for its full expression the most effective
instrument that can be placed at its disposal, and
this is the whole case for Eugenics. How that
efficiency of instrument is to be secured for the
majority is another matter. Certainly it will never
be found along the lines of stock. We have before
us hundreds of examples of thoroughly fit persons
of both sexes whose children are weaklings or mentally
defective. I have cited two cases of women
simultaneously bearing children in the same hospital.
One child dies and the other lives. Why? They
were born under the same stellar conditions. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>had equal care from their births onwards. The
reason is that in one instance the mother’s horoscope
shows success in progeny from the presence of
Jupiter in the <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr> House, and the other shows no
success at all from the presence of Saturn in that
part of the heavens. Both mothers were perfectly
fit in themselves and in the same station of life.
Obviously there is here imported a factor that is of
immense importance to those who have a mind for
improving the race. Seed, Season and Soil are all
essential to the production of healthy offspring.
Our Eugenists leave out of consideration the factor
of Season. They imagine that, given healthy parents,
you are bound to have healthy children. Nothing
is further from the truth, if we regard children as
composite beings and not merely as animals. We
may frankly admit that the personality determines
the final <i>expression</i> of character as the coloured
glass through which the ray of intelligence finally
strikes upon us, but to confound character with
environment—and there is no environment which
presses a man more nearly than his physical body—would
be to negative the whole effort of reform.
Character is inherent and is imported to the physical
environment. It is not derived from it. It is no
by-product, but a thing as essential to Soul as shape
is to matter. Beyond the fact of physical heredity,
which counts for a great deal where bodies are
concerned, there is the yet more important factor
of psychic tradition. The importation of this factor
into the problem is of the utmost significance, and I
venture to say that apart from a thorough sounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of modern Psychology and Occultism, and a due
consideration of all the factors that go to the making
of a man, there will be no satisfactory solution of
the problem modern Eugenists have before them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the analysis of personal efficiency we find three
factors in co-operation: faculty, function and
instrument. All faculty is strengthened and increased
by use or function. Function it is that
adapts environment to its needs, as a force pressing
towards expression in matter. For the expression
of faculty, therefore, we need functional integrity,
adaptation of environment, and efficiency of instrument.
It has been said that, given an instrument
that is out of tune there would not be much difference
in expression of faculty between an impresario and
a man entirely ignorant of music. This is true only
in time and as regards the immediate effort of each.
But one can very well see that there are essential
differences which will very soon be made manifest.
The musician would know that the instrument was
defective, while the other would not. In a short
while the musician would get that instrument into
tune so that he could express his faculty. The man
ignorant of music could not attempt the business.
Character counts for more than environment, and
faculty than instrument.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now in our Occultism we distinguish between that
which is incidental, as faculty and character; and
that which is accidental, as instrument and environment.
It is recognized that the horoscope of birth
is accidental in this sense, and represents the
cosmical and mundane environment in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>character is required to express itself. It represents
a composite of cosmic forces energizing through two
great streams of heredity. But it is not essential
to the man, as is character. It is not going to damn
him for ever or confer on him the guerdon of a
blessed immortality. It is merely an environment,
and that but a temporary one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Astrologers classify characters into three primary
groups, representing stability, flexibility and incisiveness,
or again, originality and independence,
adaptability, and executiveness. These answer to
the grouping of the planets in the several signs of the
zodiac, namely, the Fixed, Common and Cardinal
signs, otherwise known as the grave, circumflex and
acute. These may be tabularized in the following
manner—</p>

</table>

<p class='c006'>From this grouping we know at once what is the
predominant mould of character and hence what
environment is most suitable for the exercise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>expression of that character. And as applied to
eugenics, we are able thereby to make selection of
suitable partners in life, setting off the stability of
the one by the flexibility of the other, and so on.
Take, for instance, the man who shows a predominant
flexibility of character, wide sympathies, versatility,
prolixity and diffuseness. He is apt to become a
dabbler, never thorough, and <i>aliquid in omnibus</i>.
Obviously his ambitions need pointing, his faculties
concentrating, and his natural powers conserving.
Bring him into relations with a woman who has a
majority of the planets in cardinal signs, and he will
find one who can be of the greatest use to him in the
shaping of character and the directing of his ambitions
and powers.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might ring the changes and derive from these
three types seven distinct characters, all mutually
interdependent and capable of fulfilling some
special function in the economy of life, but never
wholly of service when working alone. It is from
the interplay of human character in the ordinary
course of life that the main purpose of human
evolution is served.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has already been shown that the lunar sphere
is the last of those through which the incarnating
entity passes when it proceeds towards mundane
existence. It has been shown also that the Moon
exercises a most important influence in human
generation. It is to the Moon, therefore, that we
look for the final determination of that personal
colouring which is the prime environment of the
Soul. Accordingly we find that the Moon’s position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>in a horoscope of birth is of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not only does the Sign occupied by the Moon give
to the character a special colouring, but the decanate
and even the degree that is held by it play their part
in the final determination of the personal colouring.
But inasmuch as there is an adaptation of means to
end and of character to environment, we may go
further and infer character as indicated by the lunar
position. In this way the whole phenomenal world
may be regarded as the reflex of the noumenal.
The person, as phenomenon, assumes a cosmic and
spiritual significance. He is one of the divine
symbols.</p>

<p class='c006'>To take a concrete instance. The Kaiser Wilhelm
<abbr title='the second'>II</abbr> was born with the Moon in the <abbr title='twenty-eighth'>28th</abbr> degree of the
sign Scorpio, which is ruled by the Sun, the sign being
under the dominion of the planet Mars. The Moon
is opposed by Uranus, which disposes to a wayward
and autocratic disposition, some degree of eccentricity,
a nature subject to impulses and precipitate
actions. The Moon therefore takes the prime
colouring of the planet Mars, because it is in the
sign of Mars, Scorpio, and we accordingly find that
Mars is a very prominent planet in the horoscope,
being in the Mid-heaven and near the conjunction
with Neptune. It is not, therefore, surprising that
the Kaiser Wilhelm has received the name of “War
Lord.” He represents the fighting principle which
makes for conquest and freedom. Zeal, courage,
enthusiasm, enterprise and frankness are among
the martial attributes. To these attributes, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>solar degrees held by the Moon will contribute a
degree of pride, love of fame, glory and display.</p>

<p class='c006'>Take another instance. Napoleon <abbr title='the first'>I</abbr> was born
with the Moon in the <abbr title='twenty-eighth'>28th</abbr> degree of the sign Capricornus.
The sign is ruled by Saturn, and we find
Saturn in the most prominent position in the
horoscope, being in the Mid-heaven in opposition to
the Moon. Saturn is in the sign Cancer, and he died
from the disease associated with this sign. The
degree is ruled by the Sun. Here we have the Moon
in the cardinal sign Capricorn, ruled by Saturn, the
most powerful planet in the horoscope. It is
altogether suitable to the “Man of Destiny.” The
degree held by the Moon is ruled by the Sun, and
this gives the desire for fame, honour, glory and
rulership. The decanate of the sign occupied by the
Moon is related to the sign Aries ruled by Mars, and
here we have the military instinct. But the presiding
influence in the horoscope is undoubtedly
that of the planet Saturn, in whose sign the Moon is
found at the moment of birth. Saturn had an
ancient reputation of devouring his own children,
which means that those whom he raises in the world
he eventually despoils. It was thus in the case of
Napoleons <abbr title='one'>I</abbr> and <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>, both of whom had the planet in
the Mid-heaven of their horoscopes. But the tally
of its victims is a lengthy one, and includes all grades
of life. What sphere is likely to be occupied by the
subject of this or any other horoscopical influence
coming through the Moon, depends most of all upon
the position of the planet governing the Moon-sign,
that is, the Sign in which the Moon is placed at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>birth. Thus I find that Rudyard Kipling has the
Moon in Gemini, and this is ruled by Mercury, who
is in the sign Sagittarius in conjunction with Venus.
Mercury is pre-eminently the representative of
literature and Venus that of poesy. But the Moon
is also in the degree of Gemini that is ruled by Venus,
and in that part of the sign which reflects the sign
Aries, so that we have direct evidence of the military
associations of his poetical genius. The poet Shelley
was born with the Moon in Pisces, which is ruled by
Jupiter, a powerful planet in his horoscope, and,
conjoined with the planets Mars and Neptune,
denoting the fearless and zealous nature allied to
mysticism and inspiration. The Moon being in a
degree that is ruled by itself, denotes that love of
change and that restless inconsequence which
characterized his life, while the Moon, being in the
decanate which reflects the sign Cancer, adds that
abiding love of maritime pursuits which eventually
brought about his death, and once more accentuated
the import of the phrase: “the ruling passion
strong in death!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nelson was born with the Sun in the sign Leo, and
the Sun, its ruler, in elevation. Shakespeare was
born with the Moon in Taurus, with Venus its ruler
in elevation. Thus we see that all those who have
distinguished themselves in their sphere of life
have the ruler of the Moon-sign in a prominent
position in their horoscopes, and further that the
exact position of the Moon as to decanate and degree
gives us the particular setting of the character and
the special faculty by which they are distinguished.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Yet while the study of character and environment
from the point of view of Astrology is in every way
satisfactory to those who take it seriously in hand,
it does not in itself afford that degree of evidence
that is looked for by people newly acquainted with
its claims and teachings. For human character is
a very complex thing, and universally shows the
admixture of elements that are common to all in a
greater or less degree. It is rather in the specialization
of some one characteristic that persons become
distinguished. It is sometimes in the suppression
of some prevailing characteristic that others attain
distinction. Thus we see that the selfless devotion
of one man to the needs of others draws him away
from the mass of commonly selfish people. Accentuation
and abnegation may thus both claim their
hold upon the public esteem, yet always it is
thoroughness that makes its mark in the world, and
by that I mean the steadfast adherence to a plan
of life which wins its way through in the end. So
then, we see that the evolution of the unit from
the mass, the specialization of faculty in the individual,
is the law of Nature, and it hardly needed the
philosophy of Nietzsche or the cult of the Superman
to enforce the fact upon our minds. And yet, after
all, there is no individual evolution possible for man
apart from the race to which he belongs, and when
all is done that self-effort can accomplish, when we
have specialized and perfected to the highest
possible degree, what remains but that we must
perforce acknowledge our indebtedness to the world
and find our whole destiny to consist in the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of mankind. Thus Bulwer Lytton makes Zanoni
to say: After all I perceive that the common lot
of mankind is its greatest and its sweetest blessing!
Astrology at all events has no higher doctrine than
this: Study how best to serve.</p>

  <h2 id='chap27' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-seven'>XXVII</abbr> <br> THE LAW OF SEX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Synthetic Philosophy and Comparative Theology
have sought wisely to establish a common basis for
human thought and aspiration. From the complex
of life and thought they have argued to fundamental
unity. It has been well said that the foolish and
superficial look for differences in things about them,
but the wise seek for the underlying identity. In
the last analysis of things animate and inanimate,
we are faced by the insoluble fact of sex
distinction.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we speak of chemical affinity, of magnetism,
of polarity, we are really speaking in terms of sex.
However far we push back our investigations along
the lines of evolution we come at length to the
distinction which separates one-half of nature from
the other, and which is seen to be at the root of all
natural attractions and to be the source of generation.
Sex, as considered by itself and apart from
function and organism, may be the result of a mode
of vibration. We cannot say. We may go right
back to the first principles of our conception of
Life and we find the active and passive principles of
Force and Matter, Heat and Moisture, Fire and
Water, penetrating through the various philosophies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>and schools of thought, but always a duality. Even
in the Theological conception we have the divine
principles of Wisdom and Love in apposition, but
united for the purpose of Creation and Preservation
of the Universe. It is a mystery that cannot be
solved. We cannot in fact, determine whether sex
distinction is temporary or eternal. We have
reason to regard it as radical and not accidental.
For whereas in the process of evolution it appears
from time to time to merge in various forms and
to become hermaphroditic, we find it continually
emerging again, persistent and irrepressible.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the occult point of view it appears to be
impounded in the very elements of our being. It has
been shown in these pages that the Microcosmic Man
is an epitome of the universe, compounded of universal
elements, and responsive at all points to the
laws controlling the cosmos. It has also been shown
that the Moon, so far as this earth is concerned, is
the cosmic factor which represents variability. It
has also been shown that it exercises first influence
in the process of generation, and, therefore we may
expect to find it intimately connected with the
question of sex. It is, in fact, found to be the factor
which determines the astral forces towards the
evolution of sex function and organism.</p>

<p class='c006'>By an empiricism based on an occult law and
proved by the application of this law to hundreds
of cases of well-authenticated births, it has been
established that the determination of sex follows
a definite course from a certain point of time bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>a mathematical and astronomical relationship to
the moment of birth. Thus, given the moment at
which a birth took place in any locality, it is possible
to at once indicate the sex without the fact being
communicated. By this I do not mean that sex
production is voluntary in human or animal generation.
That is a problem which the Eugenists should
consider in the light of the law of sex I am now
concerned with.</p>

<p class='c006'>The four cardinal points of the zodiac, Aries 0°, Libra
0, Capricorn 0 and Cancer 0, are the generating points
of the circle or Wheel of Life. These points are not
artificial. They are natural. They mark the stages
at which the Sun in its apparent course about the
earth cross the equator, and attain the maximum
and minimum degrees of elevation. By analogy
they are related to the Dawn, Noon, Sunset and
Midnight of the daily circle; to the Spring, Summer,
Autumn and Winter of the year; and to the periods
of Childhood, Manhood, Maturity and Senility in the
life of man. It is this consent of Nature to the
universal paradigm that enables us to trace the
course of mundane events from astral conditions in
force at these several points of the year, as Kepler
allowed from his own experience, and as Astrologers
find continually to be the case.</p>

<p class='c006'>Taking these four points of the zodiac, then, as
the starting-points for the determination of cosmic
forces ultimating as sex, we find that Aries 0 is
female, Capricornus 0 male, Libra 0 male and
Cancer 0 female. They follow the lines of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>segmentation of the cell in the animal organism.
Thus—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig28.jpg' alt='Figure 28.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 28.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From each of these points there are six others generated,
which are alternately male and female in
potentiality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it is necessary to introduce the lunar factor,
since it is the means of the distribution of the “sex
degrees” as we may call them, which are generated
from the four cardinal points. For this purpose we
have to regard the moon in relation to the number
7, which is the number of days in which it forms
its successive phases. From one phase to another
is a quadrant of 90° and this divided by seven will
give the mean acceleration of 12-6/7°. If we divide
the circle into seven parts we shall get 51-3/7° and
further dividing this into four parts, in order to get
the twenty-eight days of the Moon’s passage, we shall
have again 12-6/7°.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the septenate division of the circle which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>enables us to get the sex degrees that are generated
from the four cardinal points. Thus, from Aries 0
we arrive at Taurus 21-3/7, Cancer 12-6/7, Virgo 4-2/7,
Libra 25-5/7, Sagittarius 17-1/7, and Aquarius 8-4/7. These
are found to be male and female in alternation.
From Libra 0 we derive the same degrees of the
opposite signs, but the sex is reversed in each case.
From Capricornus we derive Leo 21, Libra 13,
Sagittarius 4, Capricorn 26, Pisces 17, and Taurus 8,
the sex of each being the same as the corresponding
degrees of the zodiac generated from Libra. From
Cancer we derive the same degrees of the opposite
signs to those derived from Capricornus, but the
sex is reversed in each case.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are thus four sets of degrees alternately
male and female in tendency which are generated
from the four cardinal points, and these may be set
out in order as derived, thus—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/fig29.jpg' alt='Figure 29.' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Figure 29.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It will be observed that the fractions are omitted
and the nearest complete degree inserted. Then if
we arrange these four sets of degrees into their
groups under the radical generator, we shall have
a central generating point with a six-pointed star or
interlaced triangle around it, the upright triangle
being male and the reversed triangle female at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>radials. Each of these stars will occupy one of the
four cardinal points of the Cosmic Cross.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<p>Figure 30. Diagram of the Cosmic Star. Showing the generation of the Sex Degrees of the Zodiac from the Four Cardinal Points.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The application of the Law of Sex requires some
little astronomical practice. It is first of all necessary
to find the place of the Moon at the time of
birth. If the moon is found in a sex degree or
within three degrees of one, it will retain the sex of
that degree. Otherwise, it is necessary to observe
whether the Moon is increasing or decreasing at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>time, and if increasing, the Moon’s place must be
put on the East horizon, but if decreasing, it will be
on the West horizon. This position is found to
answer to the Moon’s place at the Prenatal Epoch,
concerning which some explanation is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The normal period of human gestation is nine
solar or ten lunar months. It will be found that the
moon makes ten revolutions while the Sun passes
through nine signs of the zodiac. But this normal
period may be increased or decreased, and that
quite normally, by the relative positions of the
luminaries at the time of inception. I use this word
to distinguish it from conception, which term connotes
certain physiological processes and facts.
The astral factor should not be identified in point
of time with the physiological processes of coitus
and impregnation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it is found that when at birth the Moon is
increasing in light, that is, going towards the full,
and above the horizon, or conversely, decreasing
in light and below the horizon, the period from
birth to inception is <i>less</i> than ten lunar months by a
quantity determined by the Moon’s distance from
the horizon. But when the Moon at birth is found
to be decreasing and above the horizon, or increasing
and below the horizon, the period of time from birth
to inception is found to be <i>more</i> than ten lunar months
by a quantity determined by the Moon’s distance
from the horizon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The measure of this plus or minus quantity is thus
computed. The Moon’s distance is taken from the
horizon East or West, according as it is increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>or decreasing in light. If increasing, it is taken
from the East, and if decreasing from the West.
The number of zodiacal degrees between the Moon
and the horizon thus indicated has then to be
divided by the Moon’s mean diurnal motion, which is
13° 11´ roughly, and this will be the number of days
more or less than ten lunar revolutions by which
the birth is separated from the inception.</p>

<p class='c006'>This calculation from the Moon’s position in the
zodiac and prime vertical enables us certainly to
fix the day of the inception. The next step is to
find the time of day at which the Moon is in exact
horoscopical relations with the moment of birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is done by a single observation. In all normal
cases it is found that if the Moon is increasing in
light at the time of birth, that is to say, going from
the new to the full, its longitude at the moment of
birth will be the ascendant at the inception, and if
decreasing at birth its longitude will be the descendant
at the moment of the inception. Then universally
it is found that the Moon is, at that moment, in
the exact longitude which was rising or setting at the
birth. Now having the moon’s acceleration as a variable
factor, ranging from 11° 50´ to 15° 17´ per day,
the chances are millions to one against the Moon
being in the exact degree and minute that was on the
horizon at birth at the same time that the Moon’s
place at birth was rising or setting on a local horizon.
Yet this is found to be the fact! What other conclusion
can we come to, having regard to all the
factors employed, and the wonderful harmony that
is observed to result, than that “God geometrizes,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>as Plato wisely said. Things do not happen by
chance, but by law. Law is the expression of
intelligence inhering in action. The universe is
rendered intelligible by its laws. Whatever is
intelligible expresses Intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we have yet to consider the variation of the
law that is conformable to the Law of Sex. This
Law of Lunar Appulsion in the matter of human
generation would work out exactly as stated above
in every case were it not for the fact that Sex is
the dominant and controlling factor, and that by
reason of it a birth may be delayed or advanced
by a period ranging from a fortnight to as much as
two months. For, whatever may be the other
factors involved in the horoscopical conditions of
a birth, sex must be satisfied first and foremost. It
is the controlling factor. Observe, then, that if the
birth is male and the Moon occupies a female degree,
as indicated above, should the Moon be increasing
in light, the Law of Lunar Appulsion already detailed
will require that the Moon’s place should rise at the
Epoch of inception or, as it is called, the “Prenatal
Epoch,” and consequently a female degree would
be rising at such Epoch. This would be contrary
to the sex, and consequently we know that the
Moon’s place at birth must be setting at the Epoch,
so that a male degree may be rising. This is the
case, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatus mutandis</i></span>, when the Moon is in a male
degree and the sex is female. Then, this adjustment
being duly made, it is found that the horoscope
resulting will find the Moon in the exact degree that
was rising at birth. Exactly similar considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>hold in the case of a Moon that is decreasing at birth.
This is the first establishment of the Law of Sex as
controlling the time of birth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next is when the Moon does not occupy a sex
degree but is more than three degrees removed from
either male or female degrees. In such case we
have to consider whether the degree on the horizon
at the moment of birth pertains to either sex. For
if it be so, and the degree is of the sex of the child
born, then we know that the Moon was in that
degree at the Epoch, whether it was increasing or
decreasing in light at the birth. This will control
the day of birth in the same way that the first rule
controlled the moment of it. Only when neither
the Moon nor the horizon are occupied by sex degrees
the Law of Lunar Appulsion operates without
restriction. This clearly shows that the Law of
Sex is paramount, and that it can and does control
the Law of Lunar Appulsion. By appulsion we mean
that outbreathing from the moon-sphere towards
the earth which corresponds to the diastole of respiration,
by which the vital forces of the cosmos
focussed by the Moon are carried towards the earth
for the production and sustentation of the species.</p>

<p class='c006'>If this Law were a matter of chance it will be seen
by any one acquainted with the astronomical facts,
that the chances are dead against it working out in
practice. Yet the facts are in daily test by astrologers
the world over, and we may hence conclude
that the Law of Sex has absolutely been discovered,
or at all events the rules by which we may recognize
its cosmic relations.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>With a closer knowledge of the initial stages of
generation, it will be possible, by a reversal of the
factors here employed, to argue from the inception
to the birth, instead of as now from the birth backwards
to the Epoch of inception. In such case we
shall have obtained the secret of how to determine
the sex of offspring at will. That the Prenatal
Epoch here established answers to some incipient
stage of the process of generation there can be no
reasonable doubt whatever, for wherever the time
of birth is accurately taken by a medical man it
answers exactly to the astronomical considerations
required by the Law as formulated. Elsewhere I
have delivered a diagram showing the Moon’s
position for each month from the inception to the
birth, from which we see that there is a definite law
of pulsation marking a spiral descent of the Monad
along the line of energy instituted between the
Moon’s place at the Epoch and the point of the
zodiac on the horizon at the moment of birth. This
I have called the Descent of the Monad, and it
affords a study of the greatest psychological value.
Very many attempts have been made on the part of
gynecologists to ascertain the law controlling Sex,
and I have introduced this section in the hope that
such as may have a practical interest in this question
will avail themselves of the facts so far derived from
the study of occultism.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>
  <h2 id='chap28' class='c004'>CHAPTER <abbr title='twenty-eight'>XXVIII</abbr> <br> A TEST OF VALUE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The Old Philosopher of China has said that the
virtue of everything is in its use. If Cosmic Symbolism
cannot be applied to the practical ends of life
it will not succeed in appealing to the average intellect,
which sets for its standard the single test
of utility. In these pages I have endeavoured to
show that the Universe as Symbol is best studied
in relation to its bearing on the common needs of
humanity. I have also shown that Astrology is
the only system of thought and practice that
attempts the application. I propose now to examine
the educational value of this study and its
practical use in daily life, and thus to place it among
the list of those subjects that have a serious claim
to the consideration of enlightened people.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tracing our way through the Encyclopædia of
knowledge we find that most of the deeper studies
that engage the powers of men are valuable, not
so much for the ends they lead to, as for the mental
training obtained in their pursuit. It is one of the
outstanding features of modern scientific methods
that we are required to bring our theories into
agreement with known facts. The facts themselves
are often uninteresting and of small practical value,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>but they serve as landmarks by which to direct our
course towards conclusions which in themselves
are often valuable. It is thus with astronomy.
The application of the <i>Principia</i> or of the Laws of
Kepler to the cosmos as we know it is an exercise
requiring the greatest possible care, considerable
mathematical ability, and the patience of a Prometheus.
The bare facts of astronomy are not generally
interesting. We are not solicitous of knowing
in exactly how many days, hours, minutes and
seconds the planet Jupiter completes its course
about the Sun. What is of more practical interest
to us as terrestrials is to know Jupiter’s relations
to this world of ours, what it stands for in the
economy of life, and what influence, if any, it
exerts over us.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now Astrology, while employing all the elements
of astronomy that have any certain foundation in
fact, is calculated as a study to engage all the
highest faculties of the human mind, while it brings
to the results obtained the added virtue of utility.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Professor Max Müller once paid Astrology
a great tribute when he said that many of our most
distinguished men of intellect were at this day
practiced astrologers, but that “few cared to let
their studies be known, so great was the ignorance
which confounded a science requiring the highest
education with that of the ordinary gipsy fortune-teller.”
Possibly he had in mind the late Lord
Chief Justice, or Dr. Richard Garnett, or indeed
any one of the host of intelligent students who
have secretly avowed their adherence to the science.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>That which held the admiration of Claudius Ptolemy,
and received the imprimatur of Tycho and Kepler,
which attracted Lord Verulam, Francis Bacon,
and was held in the highest esteem by that trained
scientific observer and profound thinker, Sir Isaac
Newton, and which in all ages and nations has
included the highest intellects among its votaries,
is affirmed by the great Orientalist to have a real
value in the estimation of modern students whose
attainments have placed them in a position to judge
in the matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us, therefore, look soberly and carefully at
this science of Astrology and see if its study is likely
to be at all profitable from the point of view of
education.</p>

<p class='c006'>Astrology is both a science and a philosophy.
As science it is concerned with the facts of astronomy
and as philosophy with the application of those
facts to the problems of life and mind. The astronomical
facts are of first interest. Before we can say
anything at all about the interplay of planetary
action in human life we have to be able to set a
map of the heavens for any time and place at which
a person may have birth. For this purpose one
can avail himself of the Ephemerides of the
<i>Nautical Almanac</i>, the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i>, or
any of those cheaper publications which are extracted
from them. From various handbooks
written by astrological authors he may then learn
how to erect a horoscope or map of the heavens
for any time and place. Such practical knowledge
is not to be found in any exposition of astronomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>that I have yet come across. It enables the student
to observe with perfect accuracy in what relations
the various heavenly bodies were at the given time
and exactly where they were situated as seen from
a particular locality on the earth’s surface. The
student finds considerable satisfaction in this piece
of practical work. But it is only preliminary to
the further study of the subject. For it will be
seen that whereas the positions of the planets at
the moment of birth have a symbolical value as
regards the whole tenor and course of the life, the
particular times at which events prefigured are
likely to take place can only be known from a
study of the subsequent motions of the heavenly
bodies after the date of birth. For it is from the
constant changes taking place in the kaleidoscope
of the greater world about us that we draw our
conclusions as to the time and nature of events.
The planets are continually altering their relative
positions owing to their different velocities and they
thus form aspects or certain angular distances in
regard to the places of the planets in the horoscope
of birth and also among themselves in the heavens.
The process of bringing a planet to the place of
another in the horoscope of birth is called “directing”
and involves a knowledge of spherical trigonometry.
This brings me to an interesting fact.
It is that the whole science of astronomy and the
art of making ephemerides of the planets’ positions
was kept alive solely by the personal labours and
special knowledge of a handful of practical astrologers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Alphonsine Tables which were composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>by the Arabian and Spanish astrologers and which
were collected under the command of Alphonso X
of Castile at a cost of four hundred thousand crowns,
and published with a royal preface in the year 1252,
are among the earliest examples of their great
devotion. The Almagest of Ptolemy was completed
about <abbr class='spell'>A.D.</abbr> 148 and was inscribed in the Temple of
Serapis. The Rudolphine Tables composed by
Tycho and completed by Kepler were digested and
recomposed by Morinus, Mathematical Professor
to the King of France, and printed at Paris in the
year 1650. Ptolemy, Tycho, Kepler and Morin
were all practiced astrologers. The <i>Nautical
Almanac</i> was first published in 1767 by Dr. Neville
Maskelyne, and afterwards greatly improved in
1834. The <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> was published
in 1699. Whence, think you, did the astrologers
obtain their information regarding the positions
of the planets prior to these years of authorized
publication? They calculated them for themselves.
Without astronomy there could be no Astrology.
They kept astronomy alive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very few people understand what labour there is
attaching to the production of the various elements
that one finds in the common almanac. How many
of my readers are prepared to calculate for themselves
the time at which the Sun will rise or set
upon the horizon of a particular locality? How
many could say with any certainty at what time
the Moon would south, or cross the upper meridian?
What percentage of people could say when and
where an eclipse of the Sun or Moon would occur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>where it would be visible, its extent and duration?
The modern astrologer has a remarkably easy time
compared with the labours of his predecessors. He
can refer to his official guide, or consult the popular
almanac for all his elements. But for the working
out of a horoscope and its subsequent directions,
he must certainly have a practical knowledge of the
use of an astronomical ephemeris.</p>

<p class='c006'>From astronomy his attention is turned at once
to Geography. He has to determine the exact
longitude and latitude of a place, the name only
of which is given, for he has to make his map of the
heavens as seen from the place of birth. Here he
gets a practical knowledge of localities and of the
orientation of horoscopes. In his pursuit of Astrology
the student will find himself tracking back
through the biographies of great men and women
in order to find data from which to test the various
ascriptions of the astrologers. He will turn up
cases of dementia and insanity in persons of repute
and compare the data afforded by their horoscopes
with the rules of Ptolemy, Morinus and Cardan.
He will incidentally acquire a considerable knowledge
of men and things which else had been to him an
unwritten book.</p>

<p class='c006'>Further, testing the theory of eclipse influences
he will inevitably find his way back to the ruined
cities of Nineveh and Babylon and the three
historical eclipses which preceded the downfall
of the great Empire, which eclipses we have received
from Hipparchus through the Syntaxis of
Ptolemy. As to the latter there are the Greek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Latin and English editions of the work open to
his study.</p>

<p class='c006'>The student will not proceed far before he comes
up against the problem of Calendarics. He will
find it impossible to understand and follow the
works of the ancients without some notion of the
equilization of Eras, and it will become imperative,
if he would check the statements made in their
works, as he should do, that he undertake the task
of converting ancient into modern calendars. He
may even find it necessary to know the names of
the Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Indian and Chinese
months. It is all involved in the process of his
study. He will certainly require to know what
are the Eras of the Hegira, the Salivahana, the
Olympiads, and the Kali Yuga.</p>

<p class='c006'>Keen on the track of this ancient lore he may
elect to study the primitive Chinese language, and
the noble Sanskrit of India, the more perfectly to
acquaint himself with the traditions of these peoples
and to study their ancient presentment of the
science of Astrology. He may conveniently follow
up the record through the Greeks and Latins.</p>

<p class='c006'>Assuredly he will need to acquaint himself, at
least superficially, with the anatomy of the human
body, its physiology, pathology and hygiene. In
the allocation of faculty to environment he will
come into touch with sociology and will discriminate
between the planetary occupations cited by Ptolemy
and those that enter into the complex of modern
life. In connection with the questions of marriage
and progeny, the study of eugenics and gynecology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>will claim his attention. The study of character
as revealed by the planetary dispositions at the
moment of birth will bring him into touch with the
profound and as yet only partially developed science
of Psychology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cosmogony will inevitably hold his attention while
studying the effects of planetary action in the world
at large, and seismology and meteorology are
branches of mundane astrology that cannot be overlooked
by any thorough student. For the argument
comes easily to hand that if the planets do not affect
the world at large they cannot affect us as denizens
of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this by no means exhaustive category of
subjects directly connected with the study of
Astrology, it will be seen that it entails a liberal
education and one, moreover, that cannot be
matched by the curriculum of any of our schools
or colleges. So that, whether we regard Astrology
as a science, a philosophy or an occult art, it is certain
that its pursuit, if carried out consistently, cannot
fail to improve the mind of all who engage in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as Laotze has said, the virtue of everything
is in its use. If Astrology has no practical advantages
to offer us it will at best only secure a place
of academical repute. Those who have followed
it out into the broad issues of life will, however, be
able to affirm that in infancy, youth, adolescence
and old age, Astrology is adequate to the needs of
all as a source of guidance and information. From
the very outset of life we are faced by considerations
of health, questions regarding the continuance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>life, matters connected with education, the development
of special faculty, and all those problems that
vex the parental mind. Then later on we have to
decide upon the choice of occupation, and later still
on the all-important question of marriage. Then
come the host of considerations hedging the welfare
of the average man, questions regarding business
affairs, travelling, partnerships, alliances, and the
final disposition of one’s affairs. There are also
the financial problems to be dealt with, matters of
investment and of speculation—for it is never wise
to speculate unless you know—and on the domestic
side of life we have a multitude of problems which
can easily be imagined but are difficult to recite.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all these matters Astrology is found to be consistently
useful as a guide and system of foreknowledge.
Let me take some practical illustrations
of the value of foreknowledge. The Russo-Japanese
War and its outbreak in the Korea was foreseen and
specifically predicted by me from the Eclipses of
1893. The fact that thousands of persons are
directly or indirectly concerned in the appreciation
or depreciation of the commercial interests and
Government securities of those countries will point
the practical value of this piece of intelligent anticipation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Hispano-American War of 1898 was predicted
and the corner in wheat coinciding with the outbreak
of that event was foreseen. Was this of any value
to those whose business it is to anticipate the price
of commodities and to arrange their shipments
accordingly? Was the fall in Consols in 1899 on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the outbreak of the Boer War of no consequence to
trustees and financiers? Consols were then at 112
and they fell to 88. My statement to the <i>Daily
Mail</i> twelve months before the event was that
Consols next year would, on account of war, be as
much below par as they were then above it. These
are not isolated predictions carrying with them a
fictitious value as spasmodic evidences, but they
form part of a coherent and consistent system of
forecast which has been available to the public
for many years and of which many have taken
advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Judged by the test of fact and utility it will be
seen that Cosmic Symbolism as developed in the
science of Astrology is everywhere and in all directions
abundantly justified in its claim to a patient
and dispassionate investigation at the hands of
competent critics, and universally it will be found to
answer the common problems of life and to throw
a flood of light upon some of the more recondite
mysteries of our being.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this work I have sought to be rather suggestional
than informing, to stimulate rather than
to satisfy curiosity, and to entice the reader to a
consideration of some few ideas which arise out of
the study of the Universe as Symbol. In this I
trust I have been successful.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
